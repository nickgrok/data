"surveillance for elevated blood lead levels among children--united states, 1997-2001","problem/condition: lead is neurotoxic and particularly harmful to the developing nervous systems of fetuses and young children. extremely high blood lead levels (blls) (i.e.,> or =70 microg/dl) can cause severe neurologic problems (e.g., seizure, coma, and death). however, no threshold has been determined regarding lead's harmful effects on children's learning and behavior. in 1990, the u.s. department of health and human services established a national goal to eliminate blls >25 microg/dl by 2000; a new goal targets elimination of blls > or =10 microg/dl in children aged <6 years by 2010. reporting period: information regarding children's blls comes from 1) national health and nutrition examination surveys (nhanes) conducted during 1976-1980, 1988-1991, 1991-1994, and 1999-2000; and 2) state child blood lead surveillance data for test results collected during 1997-2001. description of system: cdc tracks children's blls in the united states by using both nhanes and state and local surveillance data. nhanes reports data regarding children aged 1-5 years; state and local surveillance systems report data regarding children aged <72 months. because lead exposure in children varies among populations and communities, both surveys are needed to determine the burden of elevated blls among young children throughout the united states. nhanes uses highly standardized data-collection procedures and probability samples to gather information regarding the health and nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized u.s. population. state and local childhood lead surveillance systems are based on reports of blood lead tests from laboratories. state and local programs submit data to cdc annually. in this report, confirmed elevated blls are defined as one venous blood specimen > or =10 microg/dl or two capillary blood specimens > or =10 microg/dl drawn within 12 weeks of each other. results: the nhanes 1999-2000 survey estimated that 434,000 children (95% confidence interval = 189,000-846,000) or 2.2% of children aged 1-5 years had blls > or =10 microg/dl. for 2001, a total of 44 states, the district of columbia (dc), and new york city (nyc) submitted child blood lead surveillance data to cdc. these jurisdictions represent 95% of the u.s. population of children aged <72 months and 97% of the nation's pre-1950 housing. the number of children tested and reported to cdc increased from 1,703,356 in 1997 (37 states, dc, and nyc reporting), to 2,422,298 in 2001 (44 states, dc, and nyc reporting). during that time, the number of children reported with confirmed elevated blls > or =10 microg/dl steadily decreased from 130,512 in 1997 to 74,887 in 2001. in 2000, the year targeted for national elimination of blls >25 microg/dl, a total of 8,723 children had blls > or =25 microg/dl. interpretation: both national surveys and state surveillance data indicate children's blls continue to decline throughout the united states. however, thousands of children continue to be identified with elevated blls. the 2000 goal of eliminating blls >25 microg/dl was not met. attaining the 2010 goal of eliminating blls > or =10 microg/dl will require intensified efforts to target areas at highest risk, evaluate preventive measures, and improve the quality of surveillance data. public health actions: states will continue to use surveillance data to 1) promote legislation supporting lead poisoning prevention activities, 2) obtain funding, 3) identify risk groups, 4) target and evaluate prevention activities, and 5) monitor and describe progress toward elimination of blls > or =10 microg/dl. cdc will work with state and local programs to improve tracking systems and the collection, timeliness, and quality of surveillance data.",NA,nongeographical,0,,,,
human health risk assessment of metals exposure through subsistence foods consumption and subsistence harvest activities near a mining transport road in northwest alaska,"historical transport of ore concentrate over a 50-mile haul road from the red dog zinc/lead mine in northwest alaska to a seaport has been associated with elevated lead levels on moss growing near the road and with concerns about the safety of subsistence foods. as part of a comprehensive evaluation of potential impacts to human health and the environment from metals released during overland transport of ore concentrate, a human health risk assessment was conducted. exposure to site-related metals through subsistence food consumption, water ingestion, and incidental soil ingestion was evaluated for three scenarios: child subsistence use, adult subsistence use, and adult combined occupational and subsistence use. the risk assessment used local subsistence food consumption data and subsistence harvest area information, along with metal concentrations from soil, water, caribou, fish, ptarmigan, berries, and sourdock collected on or near the road and port. the results, along with other lines of evidence, indicate that risks associated with subsistence food consumption and harvest activities are well within acceptable limits for each scenario and that subsistence foods remain safe to eat. additionally, human health risks are not elevated even when data from restricted areas of the road and port are included.",alaska,alaska,1,,environment,risk assessment,both
exposure to a mixture of metals and growth indicators in 6-11-year-old children from the 2013-2016 nhanes,"lead (pb), mercury (hg), and fluoride (f) exposure during childhood is of concern owing to their toxicity. also, evidence suggests that high and low exposure levels to manganese (mn) and selenium (se) during this vulnerable period are associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects. a reduced growth is associated with high pb and f exposure; however, little is known about their impact on children's body size, and there is a lack of consensus on the effects of hg, mn, and se exposure on children's anthropometric measures. this is particularly true for childhood metal co-exposures at levels relevant to the general population. we investigated the joint effects of exposure to a metal mixture (pb, mn, hg, and se in blood and f in plasma) on 6-11-year-old us children's anthropometry (n = 1634). median f, pb, mn, hg, and se concentrations were 0.3 mu mol/l, 0.5 mu g/dl, 10.2 mu g/l, 0.3 mu g/l, and 178.0 mu g/l, respectively. the joint effects of the five metals were modeled using bayesian kernel machine and linear regressions. pb and mn showed opposite directions of associations with all outcome measured, where pb was inversely associated with anthropometry. for body mass index and waist circumference, the effect estimates for pb and mn appeared stronger at high and low concentrations of the other metals of the mixture, respectively. our findings suggest that metal co-exposures may influence children's body mass and linear growth indicators, and that such relations may differ by the exposure levels of the components of the metal mixture.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
modelling of environmental lead contributors to blood lead in human,"the second national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes ii) is the only representative national study of body burden of lead where detailed concurrent information is available on a number of geographic and socio-economic factors. to date, however, reliable information on concurrent local environmental lead exposure for the sample has been lacking. in this study, we have identified and utilized previously unused concurrent lead exposure data. our exposure data include time and region specific information on sales of lead from gasoline and ambient air-lead measurements from the united states environmental protection agency (epa). in addition, we have included information on lead consumed in food from the united states food and drug administration (fda). our results indicate weak but significant associations between state sales of lead from gasoline and blood lead. in addition, we found a significant association between ambient air lead measurements and blood-lead concentrations. socio-economic factors and life-style factors were significantly related to blood lead, controlling for other possible confounders. overall, our model explained 34% of the variance in blood-lead levels, which is a significant improvement compared to the maximum of 25% from other studies using the nhanes ii data. the study substantiates prior findings that the majority of the variance in overall blood lead is significantly related to lead sources other than gasoline. from a public health perspective, it is therefore imperative that lead screening programs be continued and focused on multiple sources of lead, including lead in gasoline. the study supports prior findings of a continuous decrease in blood lead, independent of decreases of lead from gasoline.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
assessing the contribution from lead in mining wastes to blood lead,"lead has been recognized for years as an environmental pollutant of concern for young children. nonetheless, many children in the united states still experience high body burdens of lead. reducing exposure to lead must include an assessment of all potential sources of lead and a definition of routes of exposure. in this paper, the relationships between soil lead and blood lead concentrations in residents in communities with high soil lead concentrations resulting from past mining and ore processing (milling) activities are compared to those derived from studies in urban communities or communities with operating smelters. the impact of mine waste-derived lead in soil (usually in the form of lead sulfide) on blood lead is less than that for lead in soil derived from smelter, vehicle, or paint sources. possible reasons for a reduced impact of lead sulfide on blood lead in children in mining communities include the following: lead from mining sources contributes less to lead in the immediate environment of children than lead from other sources; mine wastes typically are of larger particle size, which decreases the bioavailability of lead in the gastrointestinal tract; and lead sulfide is absorbed less in the gastrointestinal tract compared to other lead species. a reduced impact of mine waste-derived lead on blood lead may be important from a regulatory point of view. expensive cleanup actions for lead-contaminated soils in mining communities based on acceptable soil lead concentrations derived from smelter or urban communities may be questionable in terms of reducing blood lead in children.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead toxicity: from overt to subclinical to subtle health effects,"although the toxicity of lead was recognized centuries ago, concern was restricted to overt symptoms: colic, encephalopathy, anemia, or renal disease. two major reasons for lack of progress in restricting toxicity were that interest was limited to occupational exposures and there was lack of awareness of specific biochemical or metabolic effects. identification of subclinical effects has been possible the last 15 or 20 years because of the development of sensitive measures to detect cognitive and behavioral changes that are not apparent clinically and because of methods to measure the reduced activity of heme enzymes. this progress was driven by basic and clinical research that resulted in a better understanding of cellular toxicology. the new awareness prompted the lowering of acceptable occupational exposures, as measured by blood lead from 80 to 40 to 60 micrograms/dl range, and the establishment of maximum recommended exposures in children to a blood lead level of 25 micrograms/dl. lowering the lead content in gasoline has been accomplished by a nearly 50% decrease in average blood levels of persons in the united states (nhanes ii data). current research implicates lead as a contributing etiologic factor in a number of common diseases affecting large portions of the population such as subtle cognitive and neurological deficits, hypertension, congenital malformations, immunotoxicity, and deficits in growth and development. for each of these disorders there may be multiple etiologic factors; the scientific challenge is to develop sensitive methodology to detect the specific role of lead. other potential subtle health effects include the influence of small amounts of lead on cell proliferation and lead as a cofactor in carcinogenesis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead exposure among mothers and their newborns in toronto,"recent studies have suggested that a fetal blood lead level of 0.48 mumol/l (much lower than 1.21 mumol/l, which is the level previously believed to be toxic to the developing brain) may impair brain development permanently. we measured the maternal and umbilical cord blood levels of lead and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (fep) among 95 consecutive mother-infant pairs to determine whether neonates in toronto are in the high-risk group. there was a significant correlation between the maternal and the cord blood lead levels (r = 0.59, p less than 0.0001). most (99%) of the infants had cord blood lead levels below 0.34 mumol/l; in 11 cases the levels were below the detection limit of 0.01 mumol/l. the cord blood fep levels were higher than the maternal levels. the us centers for disease control, atlanta, currently finds acceptable a blood fep level of 0.62 mumol/l among children up to 10 years of age; however, this is not applicable to newborns since their higher fep levels apparently reflect immature heme synthesis and increased erythrocyte volume rather than lead poisoning. our data suggest that living in toronto does not impose increased teratogenic risk from intrauterine exposure to lead; however, residents in high-risk areas should be followed up.",nongeographical,nongeographical,0,,,,
"blood lead levels of 4-11-year-old mexican american, puerto rican, and cuban children","data from the hispanic health and nutrition examination survey were used to estimate arithmetic mean blood lead and percent with elevated blood lead [25 micrograms per deciliter (micrograms per dl) or greater] for 4-11-year-old mexican american, puerto rican, and cuban children. the sample size was 1,390 for mexican american children, 397 for puerto rican children, and 114 for cuban children. puerto rican children had the highest mean blood lead levels (11.5 micrograms per dl), followed by mexican american children (10.4 micrograms per dl) and cuban children (8.6 micrograms per dl, p less than .05). puerto rican children had the highest percent with elevated blood lead (2.7 percent); 1.6 percent of mexican american children had elevated blood lead; less than 1 percent (0.9 percent) of the cuban children had elevated blood lead (p less than .05). mexican american girls had a lower mean blood lead level than did boys: 9.7 micrograms per dl versus 11.0 micrograms per dl (p less than .05). for both puerto rican and mexican american children, younger age indicated a higher risk of having elevated blood lead levels. mexican american children who lived in poverty had higher mean blood lead levels than did mexican american children who did not live in poverty--11.6 micrograms per dl versus 9.6 micrograms per dl (p less than .05). despite advances in primary prevention of lead toxicity in children during the past 10 years, many hispanic children are at risk of lead toxicity. approximately 19,000 mexican american 4-11-year-old children living in the southwest and approximately 8,000 puerto rican children living in the new york city area had elevated blood lead levels (greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per dl) during 1982-84.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,national study,,,
health and environmental outcomes of traditional and modified practices for abatement of residential lead-based paint,"we evaluated traditional and modified practices for abating lead-based paint in homes of children with blood-lead concentrations (pbb) greater than 1.4 mumol/l (greater than 29 micrograms/dl). traditional abatement resulted in acute increases in: 1) lead contaminated house dust (generally 3 to 6-fold over pre-abatement levels, but at abated sites typically 10 to 100-fold); and 2) the pbbs of nearly half of the occupant children. modified practices represented modest short-term improvement compared to traditional practices but were also inadequate. by six months, it was clear that neither form of abatement resulted in long-term reductions of pbb or house dust lead levels, leaving children at continued risk of excessive exposure to lead and permanent adverse neurobehavioral effects. windows were found to be high sources of lead contaminated house dust. recommendations are made for improved abatement practices including more complete abatement of window units and more effective clean-up to remove lead-bearing dust. thirteen million us children live in lead-painted dwellings. research is needed to identify abatement strategies that will be practical and well suited to the current understanding of low-level lead toxicity.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
a case report of lead paint poisoning during renovation of a victorian farmhouse,"we describe a series of four cases of childhood lead poisoning and two cases of adult lead toxicity in a professional family exposed to lead dust and fume during renovation of a rural farmhouse. initial blood lead levels in the children ranged from 2.70 to 4.20 microm/l (56 to 87 microns/dl) and all four required chelation therapy. lead-based paint poisoning, a well recognized entity among young children in poor, urban neighborhoods, is not confined exclusively to such areas.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
health status of migrant farmworkers: a literature review and commentary,"i made a computerized search of medline files from 1966 through october 1989 followed by a review of this literature. four hundred eighty-five articles were scanned; 152 were found specifically related to migrant families, while another 51 articles addressed the health of agricultural workers or farmers in general. solid data exist on dental health, nutrition and, to a lesser extent, childhood health. data also were prominent in several disease categories including certain infectious diseases, pesticide exposures, occupational dermatoses, and lead levels in children. estimates of the size of the migrant and seasonal farmworker population vary widely. basic health status indicators such as age-related death rates are unknown. prevalence rates of the most common cause of death in the united states have yet to be studied. more research is needed into the health problems and health status of migrant and seasonal farmworker families.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
determination of numbers of lead-exposed u.s. children by areas of the united states: an integrated summary of a report to the u.s. congress on childhood lead poisoning,"in response to congressional mandate and under the aegis of the federal agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr), a comprehensive report to congress on childhood lead poisoning in the united states was prepared. we have examined numbers of lead-exposed u.s. children by socioeconomic/demographic strata for children 0.5 to 5 years of age; by children in u.s. lead-screening programs; and by enumerations of children 0.5 to 5 years old in the oldest (i.e., highest paint lead and lead plumbing) housing. using blood lead (pbb) prevalence projection modeling and data of the second national health and nutrition examination surgery (nhanes ii), it is estimated for 1984 that 2.4 million black and white children 0.5 to 5 years old in metropolitan u.s. had pbb levels greater than 15 micrograms/dl. for all races and the entire nation, we estimate 3 to 4 million children will have pbb levels greater than 15 micrograms/dl. inner-city, low-income children have the highest prevalences of pbb levels above this criterion level, but sizable numbers of all strata of children have elevated pbb levels when considering both base populations and prevalences for the specific strata (total of 30 strata). lead screening programs indicate much lower numbers of exposed children compared to nhanes ii-based projections, for various reasons that allow programs to underestimate true prevalences. analysis of 1980 u.s. census bureau housing data for 318 standard metropolitan statistical areas show that 4.4 million children 0.5 to 5 years old live in the oldest u.s. housing (pre-1950). of these, most are actually in the more affluent socioeconomic strata.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
determination of numbers of lead-exposed women of childbearing age and pregnant women: an integrated summary of a report to the u.s. congress on childhood lead poisoning,"in a congressionally mandated study carried out under the aegis of the u.s. agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr) and summarized in this article, the authors have provided estimates of the numbers of american women of childbearing age and the numbers of american pregnant women whose lead exposure is sufficiently elevated to pose an intrauterine toxicity risk. exposures associated with such risk were defined as blood lead (pbb) levels greater than 10, greater than 15, greater than 20, and greater than 25 micrograms/dl. using pbb prevalence projection techniques based on the second national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes ii), we first generated projected 1984 prevalences of these pbb levels in white and black women of childbearing age, ages 15 to 19 and 20 to 44. white women in the two age bands had rates of pbbs greater than 10 micrograms/dl of 9.2 and 9.7%, respectively. for black women, the corresponding rates were 8.2 and 19.7%, respectively. combining these rates with standard metropolitan statistical areas (smsas) based 1980 census and other population enumerations show, for example, that 4.4 million u.s. women of childbearing age are estimated to have had pbbs greater than 10 micrograms/dl. pregnant black and white women in u.s. smsas are approximately 9% of the u.s. black and white childbearing age total, i.e. 3.6 million out of a 41.3 million smsa total. of these, 403,200 pregnant women were estimated to have pbb levels greater than 10 micrograms/dl.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
current issues in the epidemiology and toxicology of occupational exposure to lead,"occupational exposure to lead is widespread in the united states. clinically evident lead poisoning as well as subclinical toxicity occur in populations with occupational lead exposure. the focus of current research on lead toxicity in industrial populations is in the definition of dose-response relationships, particularly at low levels of exposure. major interest surrounds the development of biochemical and physiologic markers of subclinical toxicity. need exists to better delineate the toxicity of lead on the peripheral and central nervous system, the kidneys, the cardiovascular system, and the reproductive organs using newly developed markers. to obtain more accurate information on cumulative individual exposure to lead, future research on lead toxicity will increasingly use x-ray fluorescence analysis for determination of the lead content in home.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
methods for reducing lead-exposure in young-children and other risk groups - an integrated summary of a report to the united-states-congress-on-childhood-lead-poisoning,"as part of a congressionally mandated report on u.s. childhood lead poisoning prepared by the federal government (u.s. agency for toxic substances and disease registry [atsdr]), the authors have analyzed the relative effectiveness of measures to reduce source-specific lead exposure of u.s. children. an integrated overview of this analysis is presented in this article. two national actions, the federally mandated phasedown of lead in gasoline by the u.s. environmental protection agency and the voluntary phasedown of lead use in domestic food can production, are examples of centrally directed initiatives that have been relatively successful in limiting childhood lead exposure in the u.s. efforts to abate lead-based paint exposure of children have largely failed. this is especially true for the nation's 21 million residential units with the highest lead content paint. similarly, abatement of lead exposure from contaminated dusts and soils has generally been successful. comprehensive measures to reduce lead exposure from drinking water in residences and public facilities, e.g., elementary schools, are only now being promulgated or implemented. the full extent of their effectiveness remains to be demonstrated. there are many miscellaneous but potentially severe exposure sources that are difficult to control but require attention, such as poorly glazed foodware and ethno-specific preparations.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
implications of new data on lead toxicity for managing and preventing exposure,"recent advances in research on low-level lead poisoning point to the need to increase efforts to prevent exposure. current biomedical consensus accepts that blood lead levels as low as 5 to 15 mcg/dl are risky to fetuses, young children, and adults. lead at low dose is associated with increased blood pressure in adults, and chronic exposure has been associated in cohort studies with kidney disease and cancer. data on lead toxicokinetics also points to the hazards of low-level, chronic exposure, since the lead that is accumulated over time in bone can be released at a relatively rapid rate during pregnancy and menopause. sources that contribute to current lead exposure of the general population include unabated lead-based paint and contaminated soils, as well as lower level but pervasive sources in drinking water, food, and consumer products.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
public health. childhood lead exposure in wisconsin in 1990,"it will take the cooperation of many people to address the issue of lead poisoning. the recent death has dramatized the problem of high dose exposures. but a larger challenge is posed by the fact that most preschool children in wisconsin are not screened for lead and as a result many asymptomatic children without signs of pica behavior will experience subtle neurological damage as a result of low to moderate elevations of lead in blood. because many of these cases occur in children without recognized pica behavior, doctors need to expand screening, especially during well child visits, to identify children with elevated blood lead levels. additionally, the public health community and property owners need to evaluate and control sources of lead. major efforts are needed to address the lead hazards which now impair hundreds of wisconsin children each year.",wisconsin,wisconsin,1,,screening,screening,NA
umbilical-cord blood lead levels in california,"during the fall of 1984, we conducted a survey of umbilical cord blood lead levels of 723 live births that occurred at 5 hospitals located in 5 cities in california. historical ambient air lead levels were used as a qualitative surrogate of air and dust exposure. the area-specific cord blood means (all means approximately 5-mu-g/dl), medians, deciles, and distributions did not vary among locations. the california distributions included means that were lower than the 6.6-mu-g/dl reported in needleman et al.'s boston study in 1979. indeed, the entire california distribution was shifted to the left of the boston study distribution, even though 3% of the california cord lead levels exceeded 10-mu-g/dl-the level above which needleman et al. have documented psychoneurological effects in children during the first few years of life. fourteen percent of premature babies had cord blood lead levels above 10-mu-g/dl. the association between prematurity (i.e., < 260 d gestation) and elevated (> 5-mu-g/dl) cord blood lead was observed in all hospitals and yielded a relative risk of 2.9 (95% cl: .9, 9.2) and a population attributable risk of 47%. further research is needed to confirm this association and to explore the roles of endogenous and exogenous sources of lead exposure to the mothers who give birth to premature infants.",california,california,1,,maternity,prenatal,outdoor
residential deleading - effects on the blood lead levels of lead-poisoned children,"acute elevations of venous blood lead levels (pbb) are periodically reported in children with chronic lead poisoning, during deleading of their houses. to evaluate this phenomenon 114 preschool children who entered the massachusetts childhood lead poisoning prevention program case management system during 1984 and 1985 were retrospectively studied. pbb increased from a mean (+/- se) of 1.76 +/- 0.03-mu-mol/l (36.4 +/- 0.6-mu-g/dl) prior to deleading to 2.03 +/- 0.07-mu-mol/l (42.1 +/-1.5-mu-g/dl) during deleading (p < .001). among 41 subjects for whom deleading was done by dry scraping and sanding, the mean mid-deleading pbb was higher than the pre-deleading pbb by 0.44 +/- 0.12-mu-mol/l (9.1 +/- 2.4-mu-/dl). however, when deleading was done by covering or replacement of painted surfaces in the residences of 12 subjects, mid-deleading pbb decreased 0.11 +/- 0.12-mu-g/dl) (2.25 +/- 2.4-mu-g/dl) (p < .005). in a subset of 59 subjects who had no chelation therapy and were available for follow-up 250 +/- 14 days after completion of deleading, pbb had decreased from 1.72 +/- 0.04-mu-mol/l (35.7 +/- 0.9-mu-g/dl to 1.24 +/- 0.04-mu-mol/l (25.5 +/- 0.9-mu-g/dl) (p < .001). the long-term effect of deleading is a significant reduction in pbb. however, deleading resulted in a significant, albeit transient, increase in pbb.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,structure,abatement,indoor
occupational lead exposure and strabismus in offspring: a case-control study,"the authors conducted a population-based case-control study to investigate the association between strabismus and parental occupational lead exposure. cases were children diagnosed with nonrestrictive strabismus between 1985 and 1986 at baltimore, maryland-area pediatric ophthalmology practices and clinics (n = 377). controls were matched for age and hospital of birth (n = 377). jobs held by parents were assessed for lead exposure by industrial hygienists. the time window for lead exposure was defined as the period from conception through age 9 months. the unadjusted odds ratio for maternal lead exposure and the esotropic form of strabismus was 2.6 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.4-27). unadjusted odds ratios for paternal occupational lead exposure and esotropia were 1.0 (95% ci 0.5-2.1) for low exposure, 2.1 (95% ci 0.9-5.3) for moderate exposure, and 1.2 (95% ci 0.4-3.3) for high exposure. the study results suggest the possibility of a weak association between paternal lead exposure and strabismus in offspring.",nongeographical,maryland,0,Maryland-area mentioned which prevented the capture of Maryland,occupational,occupational,NA
the risk of lead toxicity in homes with lead paint hazard,"while lead paint has long been known to be a major source of lead poisoning, only a few small epidemiologic studies have attempted to assess directly the relative risk of lead poisoning due to the presence of lead paint. using data from over 200,000 screening tests of children in the city of chicago performed between 1976 and 1980, the relative risks can be quantified for children living in a major urban area. lead paint was found to be a significant predictor of the probability of a child having lead toxicity. as expected, the reduction in leaded gasoline sales during the period reduced mean blood lead levels and increased the percentage of lead toxic children whose toxicity could be attributed to paint lead. poisson regression models indicated that with the elimination of leaded gasoline, the relative risk of lead toxicity given lead paint exposure was 5.70 (95% ci, 4.13-7.86) during the winter and fall. the relative risk rose to 12.81 (95% ci, 7.33-22.4) in the spring and 15.8 (95% ci, 8.90-28.1) in the summer, probably due to increased exposure to window wells.",nongeographical,illinois,0,Chicago mentioned but not Illinois,structure,paint,indoor
pediatric lead screening in a suburban family-practice setting,"background. the adverse effects of lead on behavioral and intellectual development have been recognized for many years. during the past 10 years several studies have shown that lead is toxic to children at levels previously thought to be harmless. black children living in urban neighborhoods have been identified as being at greatest risk. methods. to determine whether children seen in a suburban family practice center were being exposed to lead, voluntary screening of 1-year-old patients was performed. results. over a 7-month period venous specimens for blood lead level were obtained from 40 children. seventeen (43%) of the children had levels of 0.0 to 0.2-mu-mol/l (0 to 4-mu-g/dl). fifteen (38%) had levels of 0.24 to 0.43-mu-mol/l (5 to 9-mu-g/dl). eight (20%) children had levels of 0.48-mu-mol/l (10-mu-g/dl) or greater. the highest value obtained was 0.82-mu-mol/l (17-mu-g/dl). seventy-five percent of the children with significantly elevated lead levels resided in suburban communities. conclusions. children seen in a suburban family practice setting are at risk for lead exposure, and screening should be considered by primary care physicians who practice in nonurban settings.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
blood lead levels in children and pregnant women living near a lead-reclamation plant,"objective: to determine the effect of lead contamination around a lead-reclamation plant on the blood lead levels of children and pregnant women living in the area. design: prevalence study. setting: residents living 150 m or less (high-exposure area), 151 to 400 m (intermediate-exposure area) or 401 to 800 m (low-exposure area) southeast from the plant. participants: all children aged 10 years or less and all pregnant women living in the designated area. outcome measures: correlation of venous blood lead levels with soil lead concentrations in the areas in which the subjects lived and with sociodemographic and behavioural factors. main results: of the estimated 57 pregnant women 38 (67%) participated: 20 were in the high-exposure area and 18 in the other two areas; their geometric mean blood lead levels were low (0.15 and 0.13 mumol/l respectively). of the 625 eligible children 510 (82%) participated: 169 were in the high-exposure area, 179 in the intermediate-exposure area and 162 in the low-exposure area; their geometric mean lead levels were 0.43, 0.30 and 0.26 mumol/l respectively. within each age group children in the high-exposure area had the highest levels. the mean levels for children aged 6 months to 5 years were 0.49, 0.35 and 0.28 mumol/l in the three areas respectively. within each exposure group children aged 1 to 2 years had the highest levels. no potential confounding variables could explain the relation between blood lead level and soil lead concentration. conclusions: the pregnant women's blood lead levels did not seem to be affected by exposure level, but the children's levels were primarily related to the soil lead concentration.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
an integrated exposure/ pharmacokinetic based approach to the assessment of complex exposures. lead: a case study,"a problem in evaluating the hazard represented by an environ mental toxicant is that exposures can occur via multiple media such as water, land, and air. lead is one of the toxicants of con cern that has been associated with adverse effects on heme me tabolism, serum vitamin d levels, and the mental and physical development of infants and children exposed at very low envi ronmental levels. effects of lead on development are particularly disturbing in that the consequences of early delays or deficits in physical or mental development may have long-term conse quences over the lifetime of affected individuals. experimental and epidemiologic studies have indicated that blood lead levels in the range of 10-15 kg/dl, or possibly lower, are likely to produce subclinical toxicity. since a discernible threshold has not been demonstrated, it is prudent to preclude development of a reference dose (rfd) for lead. as an alter nate, the u. s. environmental protection agency (u. s. epa) has developed the uptake/biokinetic lead model that provides a means for evaluating the relative contribution of various media to establishing blood lead levels in children. this approach will allow for the identification of site- and situation-specific abate ment strategies based on projected blood lead levels in vulnera ble human populations exposed to lead in air, diet, water, soil/ dust, and paint; thus making it possible to evaluate regulatory decisions concerning each medium on blood levels and potential health effects.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

prenatal and preschool age lead-exposure - relationship with size,"this report examines possible adverse effects on size and growth associated with subclinical prenatal and preschool age lead exposure in an urban cohort followed prospectively from birth through early childhood. measurements of weight, stature (length), and head circumference were obtained at birth and during five subsequent in-home assessments. prenatal lead exposure was assessed by cord (n = 185) and maternal (n = 162) blood lead levels at delivery. preschool blood lead samples were obtained at ages six months (n = 15 1), two years (n = 165), three years (n = 165), and four years, ten months (n = 164). multivariate longitudinal analyses incorporating adjustment for covariates revealed no statistically significant adverse effects of prenatal lead exposure on either neonatal size or on subsequent growth through age four years, ten months. similarly, no statistically significant adverse effects were found between the preschool lead indices derived from blood collected at or after age two years and ensuing size measurements. we also found no evidence for an interaction between pre- and postnatal lead exposure. a marginal inverse association was exhibited between blood lead at six months and subsequent measures of head circumference. limitations in the implications of this result in the context of many nonsignificant tests were discussed.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
black-white differences in blood pressure among participants in nhanes ii: the contribution of blood lead,"separate studies using data from the second national health and nutrition examination survey, 1976-1980 (nhanes ii) have shown that blacks in the united states have higher blood lead levels than whites and that blood lead is positively related to blood pressure. based on these reports, we examined data from nhanes ii to determine the extent to which race differences in blood pressure were explained by elevated blood lead levels in blacks. regression analyses, with race as an indicator variable, were used to estimate the contribution of blood lead to black-white differences in blood pressure. the overall effect of blood lead on race differences in blood pressure was small, reflecting, in part, the magnitude of race differences in blood lead and in the association of blood lead and blood pressure. nevertheless, a pronounced and consistent effect of lead on race differences in blood pressure was found among the poor, particularly women.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
childhood lead exposure in trail revisited,"we sought to identify modifiable determinants of elevated blood lead levels in preschool children; to compare the current situation with past information; to determine historical trends in environmental lead contamination in trail; and to find a basis for identifying appropriate precautions and protection against future lead exposure. in phase 1, blood samples were drawn from all children aged 2 to 5. in phase 2, children in the highest and lowest quartile of blood leads were surveyed by questionnaire. environmental samples of drinking water, paint, housedust, soil and vegetables were taken from their residences, and soil samples were collected from nearby parks. the average blood lead level was 13.8 micrograms/dl, range 4 to 30 micrograms/dl. this is approximately 40% lower than in 1975, when a previous survey was done, but is high compared to other places in canada. the study of environmental determinants of lead revealed that soil lead levels and, secondarily, housedust lead levels are the principal determinants of high blood lead. children with high blood leads also tended to concentrate in neighbourhoods near the lead-zinc smelter.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead exposure and growth in the early preschool child: a follow-up report from the cincinnati lead study,"this report is a follow-up of an earlier study of the effects of low to moderate prenatal and postnatal lead exposure on children's growth in stature. two hundred thirty-five subjects were assessed every 3 months for lead exposure (blood lead level) and stature (recumbent length) up to 33 months of age. fetal lead exposure was indexed by maternal blood lead level during pregnancy. the adverse effects of lead on growth during the first year of life were reported previously. this analysis covers essentially the second and third years of life. the results indicate that mean blood lead level during this period was negatively associated with attained height at 33 months of age (p = .002). this association was, however, evidenced only among those children who had mean blood lead levels greater than the cohort median (greater than or equal to 10.77 micrograms/dl) during the 3- to 15-month interval. the results also suggest that the effect of lead exposure (both in utero as well as during the first year of life) are transient provided that subsequent exposure to lead is not excessive. it appears that maintaining an average blood lead level of 25 micrograms/dl or more during the second and third year of life was detrimental to the child's attained stature at 33 months of age. approximately 15% of this cohort experienced these levels of lead exposure. continued follow-up of this cohort will reveal whether these lead-related deficits persist and whether they continue to be dependent on the level of exposure in an earlier period.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
studies on lead exposure in patients of a neighborhood health center: part i. pediatric patients,"a sharply focused study is presented defining the demographic characteristics of the catchment area of a st louis health center and determining the blood lead (pbb) levels in children from 1977 to 1989. the sources of lead exposure are examined, and the adequacy of erythroprotoporphyrin (ep) determinations are evaluated to identify children with toxic levels. mean pbb levels and prevalence rates at higher ranges were not only substantially higher in the catchment area population than in white children, but also significantly higher than in black children nationally. since 1980, mean pbb declined progressively in the catchment area children, but it was not until 1989 that the mean pbb had declined to the 1980 level in white children nationally. pbb parameters in the catchment area children were not only higher than in children in other st louis neighborhoods, but also higher than in children living in towns adjacent to a lead smelting operation. the environmental sources of lead considered here do not appear to fully account for the higher pbb levels in the children in the catchment area. nutritional factors also need to be considered. furthermore, the ep lacks both sensitivity and specificity for identifying children with pbb levels greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/dl and greater than or equal to 15 micrograms/dl. while this study identifies a community that has experiences a high prevalence of lead toxicity in its children, it also suggests that nationwide and even citywide estimates of the prevalence of lead toxicity based on ep screening may be significantly lower than actual prevalences.",nongeographical,missouri,0,St Louis mentioned but not Missouri,sociodemographic,sociodemographic,outdoor
lead-intoxication in infancy,"four years of experience in the evaluation and management of lead intoxication in the first year of life were reviewed. this study was conducted in a lead referral program within the state of massachusetts, whose comprehensive lead laws include extensive (and now mandatory) lead screening of all children. over the period of study, 50 (14%) of 370 new patients enrolled in the program were infants aged 12 months or younger. median age of these infants was 11 months (range 1 through 12 months). mean peak lead level was 39.0-mu-g/dl while the mean peak erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration was 111.9-mu-g/dl of whole blood. thirty-two percent of infants were ambulatory at the time lead intoxication was diagnosed, only 24% had a history of pica. twenty-six percent of parents were welfare dependent. apparent sources of plumbism included household renovation (n = 20), direct ingestion of paint chips (n = 10), formula preparation with lead-contaminated water (n = 9), lead dust importation (n = 1), and congenital exposure to elevated maternal lead level (n = 1). in 9 cases the source was not found. when this profile was compared with that of a randomly selected group of 47 children aged 18 through 30 months, who were seen in the lead program during the same interval, apparent sources of intoxication in the older group were paint chip ingestion (n = 41), household renovation (n = 2), and unknown (n = 4) (p < .0001). on the basis of these data, it is concluded that lead intoxication in infants is common and has significantly different origins from that in toddlers. lead intoxication from infant formula reconstituted with contaminated water may account for many of these cases. these findings support recommendations that lead screening begin at the age of 6 months for children with any likelihood of lead exposure.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,screening,screening,NA

studies on lead exposure in patients of a neighborhood health center: part ii. a comparison of women of childbearing age and children,"the second part of this study deals with blood lead (pbb) levels in 541 pregnant women and 351 nonpregnant women of childbearing age residing in the health center's catchment area. each blood sample was analyzed for erythroprotoporphyrin (ep) and pbb. comparisons of these data were made with national data on women of childbearing age and with children in our catchment area, as well as with children nationally. mean pbb and prevalence rates at greater than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 15 micrograms/dl were higher in the nonpregnant women of the catchment area than in the pregnant women. for comparison with women nationally, the data on these two groups were combined because national data did not clearly distinguish between pregnant and nonpregnant women. the women in the catchment area showed mean pbb and prevalence rates at the two ranges noted above that were not only higher than in white women but also generally higher than in black women nationally. thus, this rank order was similar to that reported earlier for children. the comparisons between women and children living in the same environment showed that the children have significantly higher mean pbbs and prevalence rates at the two ranges than the women. the physiological and environmental bases for these differences are discussed. as in the study on children, the ep is also not adequate as a screening procedure for identifying women with pbb levels greater than or equal to 25 and greater than or equal to 15 micrograms/dl.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
contributions of risk factors to elevated blood and dentine lead levels in preschool children,"the relationship between blood lead level (pbb) and an array of socio-demographic, behavioral, caregiving and environmental risk factors was investigated in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children at ages 2, 3 and 4 years and 10 months. the risk factors were also related to dentine lead level (pbd) from shed deciduous teeth. strong persistent pairwise relationships with pbb and pbd were observed for maternal iq, parental education, examiner ratings of the condition and cleanliness of the physical environment, and the home scale, which assesses the quality of the caretaking environment. the association between dirt pica and pbb was strong at 2 years (r = 0.30), but was less pronounced in subsequent assessments as the prevalence of pica decreased. insignificant or weak relationships were found for maternal assessments of paint-and-plaster peeling in the home and non-dirt pica. the home scale and the ratings of the condition of the physical environment were significantly related to pbb and pbd even after adjustment for socio-demographic factors. these two measures were also strongly related to an array of developmental outcomes. the results indicate that statistical adjustment specifically for the quality of the caretaking environment can lead to substantial reductions in estimates of adverse lead effects.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"round and round it goes: the epidemiology of childhood lead poisoning, 1950-1990","in the 40 years from 1950 to 1990, lead epidemiology and public policy based on it made enormous strides. exposure levels that caused concern in the medical and public health community fell from 80 to 10 micrograms/dl of blood. in the space of 20 years, beginning in 1970, first the surgeon general and then the cdc lowered the official """"level of concern"""" from 50 or 60 to 10 micrograms/dl. the public health community has turned its attention from the prevention of poisoning that results in encephalopathy, mental retardation, and death to the reduction of exposure to avoid subtle neurobehavioral deficits that are detectable only in fairly large epidemiological studies. numerous advances in technology and analysis have facilitated progress in lead epidemiology. in order to show that intellectual deficits were related to lead exposure rather than to such confounding variables as parental education, parental iq, income, or parents' age at time of birth, researchers performed extensive regression analyses of fairly large sample populations, controlling for as many as 39 confounding variables. these analyses would have been virtually impossible but for the development of computer software programs that became available beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s. handling of large data bases, such as nhanes ii, also required access to computer hardware and software not generally available earlier. the existence of the data depended on other technological innovations that made screening of large populations inexpensive and relatively simple. in 1973, erythrocyte protoporphyrin screening transformed testing for lead poisoning. with the advent of atomic absorption spectroscopy and rapid improvement in equipment for blood lead analysis, obtaining blood lead levels became less expensive and easier and produced more accurate results. increasing attention both to preventing environmental contamination of samples and to controlling laboratory quality also improved the accuracy of data collected. advances in screening and analytical technology made the mass screening of the 1970s possible--both the programs coordinated by the cdc and nhanes ii. nhanes ii showed the extent of the problem of lead exposure to be even greater than previously thought. it was estimated that in 1980 almost 2 percent of all children aged six months to five years had blood lead levels over the cdc level of concern of 30 micrograms/dl. more than 13 percent of black children had levels above 30 micrograms/dl. lead was certainly the most widespread threat to child health in america. in 1985, when the cdc lowered the level of concern to 25 micrograms/dl, the population defined to be at risk tripled.(abstract truncated at 400 words)",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead-exposure in a soil pica child,"a previously published report on soil ingestion in children revealed evidence that one of the subjects, a 3.5 year old female, displayed soil-pica behavior (calabrese et al., 1989). subsequent analysis of the soil-pica child data revealed that soil-pica occurred only during week two of the two-week study during which she ingested 10-13 grams of soil per day (calabrese et al., 1991) and that over 90% of the soil ingested was of outdoor versus indoor (i.e. dust) origin (calabrese and stanek, 1992). the present study revealed that on days when the child displayed soil-pica behavior she also displayed striking increases in fecal lead excretory values that could not be explained by other sources of lead exposure (e.g. food). the linking of soil ingestion and lead exposure in the soil-pica child was supported by temporal relationship as well as the magnitude of the change in both soil based fecal tracer excretion and fecal lead excretion. this paper represents the first report to our knowledge of the quantitative relationship of soil-pica behavior and exposure to lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
current issues in human lead-exposure and regulation of lead,"concern about lead as a significant public health problem has increased as epidemiological and experimental evidence has mounted regarding adverse health effects at successively lower levels of lead exposure. this concern has led to downward revision of criteria for acceptable blood lead concentrations to the 10 mug/dl mark now designated by epa as a target level for regulatory development and enforcement/clean-up purposes. much progress has been made in reducing lead exposures during the past 10 - 15 years, with marked declines evident both in air lead and blood lead concentrations in parallel to the phase-down of lead in gasoline and notable decreases in food lead exposure due to elimination of lead soldered cans by u.s. food processors. with the lessening of exposure from these sources, the importance of other components of multimedia exposure pathways has grown and stimulated increasing regulatory attention and abatement efforts to reduce health risks associated with lead exposure from drinking water, from lead-based paint, and from household dust and soil contaminated by deteriorating paint, smelter emissions, or various other sources. increasing attention is also being accorded to reduction of occupational lead exposures (including those related to lead abatement activities), with particular concern for protection of men and women during their reproductive years.

the developmental consequences of low to moderate prenatal and postnatal lead exposure: intellectual attainment in the cincinnati lead study cohort following school entry,"in a further follow-up study of the cincinnati lead study cohort, 253 children were administered the wechsler intelligence scale for children-revised (wisc-r) at approximately 6.5 years of age. postnatal blood lead concentrations were inversely associated with full-scale (fsiq) and performance iq (piq). following statistical adjustment for developmental co-factors such as maternal iq and an assessment of the quality of caretaking in the home environment, a statistically significant relationship remained between postnatal blood lead concentrations and piq. further statistical analyses suggested that averaged lifetime blood lead concentrations in excess of 20 micrograms/dl were associated with deficits in piq on the order of approximately 7 points when compared to children with mean concentrations less or equal to 10 micrograms/dl. these results are discussed in terms of their consistency with other similar studies as well as their internal consistency with earlier reports on this cohort. the findings of this investigation support recent initiatives in the united states to reduce the exposure of children to environmental lead.",nongeographical,ohio,0,Cinncinatti mentioned but not Ohio,screening,health outcome,NA
trends in the management of childhood lead poisonings,"it is unknown whether prompt medical management (with or without chelation therapy) and environmental intervention have beneficial effects other than stopping the progression towards symptomatic childhood lead poisoning. stated differently, does prompt intervention have substantive beneficial effects or are untreated lead toxic children with blood lead values between 25-54 mug/dl irrevocably damaged by the time of their identification. we are carrying out a prospective treatment outcome study with cana2edta (when indicated) at our center to hopefully answer this critical question, within the context of a multidisciplinary study. the results in 162 children indicate that environmental and medical management produce significant reductions in blood lead, erythrocyte protoporphyrin and the lead diuresis during a cana2edta provocative test. however, cana2edta treatment failed to decrease bone lead values dramatically, measured by l-line x-ray fluorescence, six months after enrollment in any patient group (treated or untreated with cana2edta). the uses of l-line x-ray fluorescence in this study and k-line x-ray fluorescence measurements of lead in bone in other reported studies open a wide time window of months to years of lead exposure, compared to 30-45 days, the time of exposure captured by blood lead levels. as with all chelating agents, dmsa should be administered to children in lead free housing, after this drug's toxicity is more widely assessed. the potential capability of dmsa to ameliorate neurobehavioral deficits produced by lead must be systematically assessed and compared with cana2edta in a randomized, controlled study before the use (s) of either drug become uncritically accepted as the treatment of choice for childhood lead poisoning, in addition to full abatement.

perinatal outcome among children of men exposed to lead and organic solvents in the printing industry,"the authors investigated the hypothesis that paternal occupational exposures at the time of conception may affect the risk of postconception events by linking records from oslo, norway, printers' unions and the medical birth registry of norway. the linkage yielded 6,251 infants born during the period 1967-1986. on the basis of job classification, fathers were categorized as to their exposure to lead and solvents. odds ratios were estimated by simple and stratified analysis of tabular data and logistic regression analysis, with children whose fathers were not in lead- or solvent-exposed categories being used as the reference group. in addition, all oslo births taking place during the same period served as an external reference for computation of standardized morbidity ratios. the adjusted odds ratio for early preterm birth (16-27 weeks) was 5.4 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.7-17.4) for infants with paternal exposure to solvents and 8.6 (95% ci 2.7-27.3) for children whose fathers were in the lead plus solvents category. the adjusted odds ratio for all perinatal deaths was 2.4 (95% ci 1.2-4.9) for children with fathers in the lead-exposed group and 1.9 (95% ci 0.96-3.7) for children with fathers in the lead plus solvents group. an increased risk of cleft lip was demonstrated, with interaction between sex and paternal exposure to lead: the standardized morbidity ratio for boys in the two subgroups with lead exposure was 4.1 (95% ci 1.8-8.1). paternal exposure had little impact on birth weight, intrauterine growth, or total number of birth defects. the main problems of the study were the potential for nondifferential misclassification of exposure and the fact that it was not possible to control for potentially confounding life-style factors.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Norway,,,

lead toxicity: current concerns,"over the 20-year period since the first issue of environmental health perspectives was published, there has been considerable progress in the understanding of the potential toxicity of exposure to lead. many of these advances have been reviewed in published symposia, conferences, and review papers in ehp. this brief review identifies major advances as well as a number of current concerns that present opportunities for prevention and intervention strategies. the major scientific advance has been the demonstration that blood lead (pbb) levels of 10-15 micrograms/dl in newborn and very young infants result in cognitive and behavioral deficits. further support for this observation is being obtained by prospective or longitudinal studies presently in progress. the mechanism(s) for the central nervous system effects of lead is unclear but involve lead interactions within calcium-mediated intracellular messenger systems and neurotransmission. effects of low-level lead exposure on blood pressure, particularly in adult men, may be related to the effect of lead on calcium-mediated control of vascular smooth muscle contraction and on the renin-angiotensin system. reproductive effects of lead have long been suspected, but low-level effects have not been well studied. whether lead is a carcinogen or its association with renal adenocarcinoma is a consequence of cystic nephropathy is uncertain. major risk factors for lead toxicity in children in the united states include nutrition, particularly deficiencies of essential metals, calcium, iron, and zinc, and housing and socioeconomic status. a goal for the year 2000 is to reduce prevalence of blood lead levels exceeding 15 micrograms/dl.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"incidence of lead poisoning in young children from inner-city, suburban, and rural communities","the centers for disease control (cdc) have recently lowered the acceptable blood lead concentration in young children from < or = 25 to < or = 10 micrograms/dl (< or = 1.21 to < or = 0.48 mumol/l). the incidence of lead toxicity with respect to geographical areas and socioeconomic status has not yet been defined. we evaluated the incidence of increased lead concentration in inner-city, suburban, and rural children aged 9 months to 3 years. seven hundred eighty of the 4,196 studied inner-city samples (18.6%) had lead concentrations > or = 10 micrograms/dl (0.48 mumol/l), of which only 71 (1.6%) had lead values > or = 25 micrograms/dl (1.21 mumol/l). only 5 of the 212 studied children (2.4%) from suburbia and 7 of the 120 children (5.8%) from rural communities had blood lead concentrations > or = 10 micrograms/dl (0.48 mumol/l). none of these children, however, had a lead concentration > or = 15 micrograms/dl (0.73 mumol/l). in contrast, 276 inner-city subjects (6.6%) had lead values > or = 15 micrograms/dl (0.73 mumol/l). our data indicate that a correlation exists between geographical location and blood lead concentration in young children. government health agencies at all levels should prioritize their limited resources for those areas that are most at risk for lead poisoning.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead-contaminated soil abatement and urban children's blood lead levels,"objective: to test the hypothesis that a reduction of 1000 ppm or more of lead in soil accessible to children would result in a decrease of at least 0.14 mumol/l (3 micrograms/dl) in blood lead levels. setting: urban neighborhoods with a high incidence of childhood lead poisoning and high soil lead levels. design: randomized controlled trial of the effects of lead-contaminated soil abatement on blood lead levels of children followed up for approximately 1 year after the intervention. patients: a total of 152 children less than 4 years of age with venous blood lead levels of 0.34 to 1.16 mumol/l (7 to 24 micrograms/dl). children were largely poor and had a mean age at baseline of 32 months, a mean blood lead level of 0.60 mumol/l (12.5 micrograms/dl), and a median surface soil lead level of 2075 ppm. interventions: children were randomized to one of three groups: the study group, whose homes received soil and interior dust abatement and loose paint removal; comparison group a, whose homes received interior dust abatement and loose paint removal; and comparison group b, whose homes received only interior loose paint removal. main outcome measures: change in children's blood lead levels from preabatement levels to levels approximately 6 and 11 months after abatement. results: the mean decline in blood lead level between preabatement and 11 months after abatement was 0.12 mumol/l (2.44 micrograms/dl) in the study group (p = .001), 0.04 mumol/l (0.91 microgram/dl) in group a (p = .04), and 0.02 mumol/l (0.52 microgram/ml) in group b (p = .31). the mean blood lead level of the study group declined 0.07 mumol/l (1.53 micrograms/dl) more than that of group a (95% confidence interval [ci], -0.14 to -0.01 mumol/l [-2.87 to -0.19 micrograms/dl]) and 0.09 mumol/l (1.92 micrograms/dl) more than group b (95% ci, -0.16 to -0.03 mumol/l [-3.28 to -0.56 micrograms/dl]). when adjusted for preabatement lead level, the 11-month mean blood lead level was 0.06 mumol/l (1.28 micrograms/dl) lower in the study group as compared with group a (p = .02) and 0.07 mumol/l (1.49 micrograms/dl) lower than in group b (p = .01). the magnitude of the decline independently associated with soil abatement ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 mumol/l (0.8 to 1.6 micrograms/dl) when the impact of potential confounders, such as water, dust, and paint lead levels, children's mouthing behaviors, and other characteristics, was controlled for. conclusions: these results demonstrate that lead-contaminated soil contributes to the lead burden of urban children and that abatement of lead-contaminated soil around homes results in a modest decline in blood lead levels. the magnitude of reduction in blood lead level observed, however, suggests that lead-contaminated soil abatement is not likely to be a useful clinical intervention for the majority of urban children in the united states with low-level lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

hazard assessment of lead,"exposure to lead (pb) continues to be a source of concern for the us food and drug administration and other united states federal regulatory agencies. blood lead levels as low as 10 mug/dl have been associated with impaired neurobehavioural and cognitive development and electrophysiological deficits in children and reduced gestational age and birth weight in infants. blood lead levels of 10 mug pb/dl are also of concern in pregnant women because of exposure to the fetus. blood lead levels of 30 mug pb/dl have been associated with elevated blood pressure and other adverse effects in adults. thus, the values of 10 and 30 mug pb/dl represent lowest-observed-effects levels for developing and adult populations, respectively. the ingestion levels that result in these blood levels of concern were estimated to be 60 mug pb/day for children ages 6 years or younger, 150 mug pb/day for children aged 7 years or older, 250 mug pb/day for pregnant women and 750 mug pb/day for adults. provisional total tolerable intake levels for lead were derived from these blood lead levels for each group by applying the renwick approach to obtain a tolerable exposure level.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

an analysis of blood lead data in clinical records by external data on lead pipes and age of household,"this study examined the possibility that lead pipes in the drinking water distribution system were elevating the blood lead levels of children in london, ontario, canada. based on their postal codes, 164 children admitted between 1984 and 1989 to an institution for the behaviorally disordered or developmentally challenged were categorized according to whether they lived in the area of the city known by the local public utilities commission to be serviced by lead pipes. analysis of covariance was used to obtain confounder-adjusted geometric means in each area. after adjusting for gender, year of lead test (a surrogate for gasoline source), and census tract prevalence of low family income, children in the lead service area (lsa) were found not to have higher blood lead levels (geometric means: lsa = 4.7 micrograms/dl, non-lsa = 4.8 micrograms/dl; p = 0.839). the average blood lead level declined 60.9% between 1984 and 1989. using municipal tax assessment data on the age of each child's home, those children living in homes built during or before 1945 (when interior paints were as much as 50% lead by dry weight) had an average blood lead level that was 62.3% higher (p = 0.011) than that of those in homes built since 1975 (when interior paints were limited to no higher than 0.5% lead by dry weight). a clear gradient was observed. this association with age of home remained significant after adjusting for gender, diagnosis, and year of lead test. variables indicating the amount of industry near the child's residence and the presence of lead service pipes did not enter the model after house-age. in conclusion, no evidence indicated that the lead service pipes were elevating blood lead levels in these london children. the data suggest that with the removal of lead from gasoline, lead-based paint is a significant remaining source of lead exposure. little data are available on childhood lead exposure from paint in canada. the present descriptive data suggest that more research into this potential problem in canada is warranted.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

perspectives on lead toxicity,"lead toxicity causes hematological, gastrointestinal, and neurological dysfunction in adults and children. symptoms are usually noted with blood lead greater than 1.93 mumol/l. severe or prolonged exposure may also cause chronic nephropathy, hypertension, and reproductive impairment. lead inhibits enzymes; alters cellular calcium metabolism; stimulates synthesis of binding proteins in kidney, brain, and bone; and slows nerve conduction. less severe exposure to lead, designated by blood lead levels of 0.48-0.96 mumol/l, has been implicated in poor pregnancy outcome, impaired neurobehavioral development, reduced stature in young children, and higher blood pressure in adults. biochemical and systemic effects of high and low level lead toxicity are described. dust, water, and paint chips are still major sources of lead but lead from folk remedies, cosmetics, food supplements, food preparation utensils, and improperly prepared infant formula has caused epidemic and sporadic severe lead toxicity. screening for pediatric low level lead exposure requires measurement of blood lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

factors influencing bone lead concentration in a suburban community assessed by noninvasive k-x-ray fluorescence,"objective.-to determine the influence of demographic, exposure, and medical factors on the bone lead concentration of subjects with background (nonindustrial) environmental lead exposure. design.-survey. setting.-suburban residential community. participants.-a total of 101 subjects (49 males, 52 females; aged 11 to 78 years) were recruited from 49 of 123 households geographically located in a suburban residential neighborhood unexposed to any major source of industrial lead emissions. main outcome measurements.-cortical bone lead concentrations in the mid-shaft of the tibia were noninvasively measured by in vivo k x-ray fluorescence. blood lead concentrations were measured by anodic stripping voltammetry. an administered questionnaire assessed potential sources of lead exposure and medical conditions affecting bone metabolism. results.-after the exclusion of one outlier, log-transformed bone lead concentration was highly correlated with age (r=.71; p less-than-or-equal-to .0001). bone lead concentration showed no significant change up to age 20 years, increased with the same slope in men and women between ages 20 and 55 years, and then increased at a faster rate in men older than 55 years. in addition to the variables age and sex, the best fitting multiple regression model for bone lead concentration (r2=.66; p less-than-or-equal-to .0001) revealed a positive correlation with total pack-years of cigarette smoking and a negative correlation with a history of having nursed an infant for longer than 2 weeks. blood lead concentrations of the subjects were low (geometric mean, 0.24 mumol/l [4.9 mug/dl]) and after log transformation were weakly correlated with log-transformed bone lead concentration (r=.23; p=.02). conclusions.-the age- and sex-related increases in bone lead concentration found by k x-ray fluorescence concur with published postmortem studies of bone lead concentration and are consistent with the kinetics of bone turnover and secular trends in lead exposure. these data help to establish a reference range for assessing the lead burden of other populations with environmental or occupational lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
long-term trends in blood lead levels among children in chicago: relationship to air lead levels,"objectives: to evaluate trends in blood lead levels among children in chicago from 1968 through 1988, and to determine the impact of the changes in the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) blood lead level of concern. methods: we reviewed a systematic sample of blood lead screening records of the chicago department of health laboratory for high-risk children aged 6 months to 5 years. median blood lead levels for each quarter of the years 1974 through 1988 were determined and regressed against mean air lead levels recorded at air-monitoring stations in chicago during the same period. results: median blood lead levels declined from 30 micrograms/dl in 1968 to 12 micrograms/dl in 1988, and were strongly associated with declining average air lead levels (r = .8, p < .001) from 1974 through 1988. a regression model using log-transformed data predicted a decline of 0.56 microgram/dl in the median blood lead level with each 0.1 microgram/m3 decline in the mean air lead level when the air lead level was near 1.0 microgram/m3; the predicted slope was steeper at lower air lead levels. despite the nearly 20-fold reduction in air lead levels, the median blood lead level of 12 micrograms/dl in 1988 indicates substantial continuing lead exposure. the cdc blood lead level of concern was lowered twice from 1968 to 1988, but due to the decline in blood lead levels, fewer than 30% of the children were above the level of concern throughout most of the study. conclusion: although substantial lead exposure persists in chicago, reductions in airborne lead emissions seem to have contributed to a long-term decline in the median blood lead level of high-risk chicago children.",nongeographical,illinois,0,Mentions Chicago but not Illinois,environment,environment,outdoor

blood lead levels in children living near abandoned metal-recovery plants,"following the identification of high levels of lead in the soils of residences near two abandoned montreal metal-recovery plants, blood lead concentrations were analyzed for children living or cared for in the affected neighbourhood. overall, the distribution of blood lead levels (geometric mean = .27 mumol/l, range .11-1.01) among the 52 children sampled was similar to those of children of other quebec localities without known point sources of lead. nevertheless, multiple regression analysis did suggest a modest influence of the concentration of lead in children's own yards (as measured by actual soil samples or as estimated by a geostatistical modeling procedure) on their blood lead level (.05 mumol/l rise for a 1000 ppm increase in soil lead, 95% c.i.-.01, .11). this estimate of the influence of soil on blood lead is at the lower end of the range reported by others. we suggest that these montreal results demonstrate the modest effects of lead-contaminated soil when its access is limited by grass cover and/or when the emissions which produced it have ceased.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
is there a need for systematic blood lead screening in canadian children?,"neuropsychological effects occurring in young children exposed to low blood lead levels are now better known. this paper reviews the need to systematically screen for blood lead levels compatible with subclinical lead poisoning in young canadian children. using standard criteria for judging the appropriateness of this measure, the authors found no evidence to support such a practice in canada. case-finding is recommended in clinical settings for children with disorders suggestive of lead poisoning, increased lead absorption or exposure to a potential source of lead. a population survey is also recommended in the presence of a well-documented community environmental lead source. there is a need for common protocols across canada for evaluating and treating children with blood lead levels compatible with subclinical poisoning. areas of priority research are: the impact of persistent environmental sources of lead such as old paint and lead in water; defining criteria for selective screening; and methods of cost-effective environmental remediation.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
contaminant enrichment and properties of soil adhering to skin,"the adhesion of contaminated soil to skin has potentially important health implications, because the contaminants may ultimately be ingested or absorbed through the skin. previous studies indicated that the adhering soil is enriched in contaminant concentration relative to the original soil because of the selective adhesion of finer particles. this study investigated this enrichment using 11 markedly different soils. two sandy soils consistently gave very high contaminant enrichment ratios, with a mean enrichment of 10-fold. the other soils all had enrichment ratios above unity. scanning electron microscopy illustrated the potential for strong adhesion of very fine clay particles. the contaminant enrichment ratios were positively correlated to enrichments in specific surface area, organic matter content, and extractable fe content. correlations to soil textural properties and detailed particle-size analysis of the adhering soil indicated that 50 to 100 mum may be a critical particle size: larger grains and aggregates do not adhere readily to skin. because of this, enrichment ratios will vary positively with the proportion of particles in the whole soil that are greater than 50 mum. a simple model is provided to predict enrichments using information from routine soil particle-size analysis.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"blood lead levels in the us population. phase 1 of the third national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes iii, 1988 to 1991)","objective: to determine mean blood lead levels and their sociodemographic correlates in the us population. design: nationally representative cross-sectional health examination survey that included measurements of venous blood lead. participants: a total of 13,201 persons aged 1 year and older examined during phase 1 of the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988 to 1991). results: the overall mean blood lead level for the us population was 0.14 mumol/l (2.8 micrograms/dl). blood lead levels were consistently higher for younger children than for older children, for older adults than for younger adults, for males than for females, for blacks than for whites, and for central-city residents than for non-central-city residents. other correlates of higher blood lead levels included low income, low educational attainment, and residence in the northeast region of the united states. national estimates for children 1 to 5 years of age indicate that 8.9%, or approximately 1.7 million children, have blood lead levels 0.48 mumol/l (10 micrograms/dl) or greater. these levels are high enough to be of health concern under 1991 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines. conclusions: the low overall mean blood lead levels demonstrate a major public health success in primary prevention efforts. however, exposure to lead at levels that may adversely affect the health of children remains a problem especially for those who are minority, urban, and from low-income families. strategies to identify the most vulnerable risk groups are necessary to further reduce lead exposure in the united states.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
cleanup of lead in household carpet and floor dust,"methods to remove lead-containing dust were tested on carpets from homes of children with high blood lead and on new carpets artificially contaminated in the laboratory. the household carpets could not be cleaned effectively by repetitive vacuuming with hepa-filtered cleaners. the lead concentration in the removed dust remained about the same from the initial cleaning (1 min/m(2)) to the final cleaning (total cleaning time of 10 min/m(2)). the lead loading on the surface of the carpets often increased during cleaning because vacuuming brought lead from deeper in the carpet to the surface. over 95% of the total dust was removed from bare wooden floors by dry vacuuming (5 min/m(2)). for linoleum, more than 75% was removed by vacuuming for 5 min/m(2). however, little was removed in vacuuming after the initial two minutes and about 20% was removed in a final wet-m,ashing step. hepa vacuuming of the laboratory-contaminated carpets revealed that two of the commercially available vacuum 1 cleaners tested were essentially equivalent and each removed significantly mol e dust than a third vacuum during a total cleaning time of 10 min/m(2). cleaning for 6 min/m(2) was necessary to remove more than 70% of the embedded dust by the two more efficient vacuums. cleaning efficiencies were about the same for short pile and sculptured carpets. it was concluded that it may be more practical to replace rather than clean carpets. hepa-vacuum cleaning of carpets was shown to increase lead dust on the surface under some conditions.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead-based paint and the lead abatement issue in the united-states,"the issue of lead abatement has been related in the media directly to lead-based paint. although other sources have been greater contributors to high blood lead levels in children according to major studies conducted in recent years, abatement programs seem to concentrate efforts on detection and control of lead-based paint in residences. this paper serves as an introduction to the history of lead used in paint. it defines current problems associated with abatement and the diversity of federal, state, and local regulations. questions under scrutiny by the courts are also reviewed. although no simple answers have been derived to detect and control lead hazards, government agencies, and professional and industrial organizations are working towards adequate definition and control of the problem. this is being accomplished by focusing on standards, specifications, guidelines, methods of analysis, and accreditation for contractors, inspectors, and laboratories needed to correct hazardous conditions.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the decline in blood lead levels in the united states. the national health and nutrition examination surveys (nhanes),"objective: to describe trends in blood lead levels for the us population and selected population subgroups during the time period between 1976 and 1991. design: two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys and one cross-sectional survey representing mexican americans in the southwestern united states. setting/participants: participants in two national surveys that included blood lead measurements: the second national health and nutrition examination survey, 1976 to 1980 (n = 9832), and phase 1 of the third national health and nutrition examination survey, 1988 to 1991 (n = 12,119). also, mexican americans participating in the hispanic health and nutrition examination survey, 1982 to 1984 (n = 5682). results: the mean blood lead level of persons aged 1 to 74 years dropped 78%, from 0.62 to 0.14 mumol/l (12.8 to 2.8 micrograms/dl). mean blood lead levels of children aged 1 to 5 years declined 77% (0.66 to 0.15 mumol/l [13.7 to 3.2 micrograms/dl]) for non-hispanic white children and 72% (0.97 to 0.27 mumol/l [20.2 to 5.6 micrograms/dl]) for non-hispanic black children. the prevalence of blood lead levels 0.48 mumol/l (10 micrograms/dl) or greater for children aged 1 to 5 years declined from 85.0% to 5.5% for non-hispanic white children and from 97.7% to 20.6% for non-hispanic black children. similar declines were found in population subgroups defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, income level, and urban status. mexican americans also showed similar declines in blood lead levels of a slightly smaller magnitude over a shorter time. conclusions: the results demonstrate a substantial decline in blood lead levels of the entire us population and within selected subgroups of the population. the major cause of the observed decline in blood lead levels is most likely the removal of 99.8% of lead from gasoline and the removal of lead from soldered cans. although these data indicate major progress in reducing lead exposure, they also show that the same sociodemographic factors continue to be associated with higher blood lead levels, including younger age, male sex, non-hispanic black race/ethnicity, and low income level. future efforts to remove other lead sources (eg, paint, dust, and soil) are needed but will be more difficult than removing lead from gasoline and soldered cans.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
societal benefits of reducing lead exposure,"while sophistication in public health research has been increasing substantially in the past few decades, sophistication in decision making about public health and environmental issues has not been increasing in parallel. measures that are inexpensive tend to be implemented and measures that are expensive tend not to be implemented by makers of public policy. that is often independent of the degree of public health protection afforded by the measures. understanding and addressing this pattern is crucial to the control of lead exposure of critical populations. people are still exposed to lead in our society not because anyone believes that exposure is good, but because reducing exposure costs money. maintaining exposure also has its costs, however. it is more difficult to measure them, and they are often ignored in decision making--but they are not small, and attempts to measure them have been made. the high cost of reducing lead exposure of critical populations is the reason that progress in reducing lead-paint exposure has been minimal in the 18 years since the passage of the lead-based paint poisoning prevention act and that it took from the time of the initial proposal in 1973 until 1986 before lead was substantially eliminated from gasoline. in its 1986 rule making, the epa estimated that the elimination of lead from gasoline would cost more than $500 million per year. removing leaded paint is estimated to cost billions of dollars. the difference is that the epa promulgated its rule of removing lead from gasoline, whereas hud has had little success in removing leaded paint from housing. one reason that the epa was successful in implementing such an expensive regulation was that it provided detailed estimates of the health and welfare benefits that would accrue and the monetary value of some of the benefits. the epa cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that the monetary benefits of its regulation far exceeded the costs. that neutralized the cost issue and focused the debate over the regulation on questions of timing. a detailed benefit analysis of reducing lead in drinking water has caused the epa to consider tighter water lead standards than initially envisioned. despite years of concern about the consequences of leaded paint poisoning, children continue to be poisoned by leaded paint because it will cost billions of dollars to abate the hazard, and demand for these dollars has lost out to competing needs.(abstract truncated at 400 words)",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

screening for lead poisoning in an urban pediatric clinic using samples obtained by fingerstick,"objective: to assess the false positive rate of blood lead (bpb) determinations on samples obtained by fingerstick from children screened in an urban clinic. method: from a single fingerstick (n = 1573), blood was collected in a capillary tube for determining lead concentration (cpb) by graphite furnace and an additional sample was absorbed onto a filter paper for determining lead concentration (fpb) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with delves cup. zinc protoporphyrin (zpp) was measured immediately and a confirmatory venous lead (vpb) specimen was obtained at the same visit if the zpp was > or = 35 micrograms/dl (0.6 mumol/l); children with either a cpb or fpb > or = 15 micrograms/dl (0.7 mumol/l) were later recalled for determining vpb. results: for the 172 children who had a vpb on the same day as the screening tests, the false positive rates (95% confidence intervals) at a lead threshold of 15 micrograms/dl (0.7 mumol/l) were: cpb, 13.5% (6.7-20.3); fpb, 19.1% (11.8-26.4). analyses using all 679 screens with a paired venous specimen (mean delay between screen and venous testing = 30 days) yielded much higher false positive rates (cpb, 31.3%; fpb, 46.0%). conclusions: screening for lead poisoning is feasible within an urban pediatric clinic by direct measurement of lead concentration in blood samples obtained by fingerstick. the false positive rate that can be obtained is acceptable given the precision of measuring bpb concentration. practitioners using a staged screening protocol may incorrectly attribute a higher false positive rate to the screening tests, when much of the error may be due to the temporal variability of bpb resulting from both biologic variability in bpb concentration and intermittent exposures.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
childhood lead poisoning prevention: the tortuous trail from human health impact assessment to effective environmental policy,"government has a long history of involvement in prevention of diseases in the us, but regulatory protection of the population from environmental health hazards did not begin until the amendments to the clean air act in 1970. shortly thereafter, studies began to show that exposure to very low levels of lead caused adverse health effects in children. the blood level at which adverse health effects are noted has been revised downward several times. lead exposure comes from polluted air, water, and lead based paints. although epa risk assessment studies showed that reductions in lead concentration in air, water, and paint would improve health and save health care and remedial education dollars, industries did not respond favorably to the added burden of lead reduction, and legislation mandating reductions has been generally slow in following the release of the studies. the centers for disease control, however, quickly issued guidelines for blood lead levels in children, and the american academy of pediatrics followed up with its own screening and case management recommendations.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the impact of soil lead abatement on urban children's blood lead levels: phase ii results from the boston lead-in-soil demonstration project,"the boston lead-in-soil demonstration project was a randomized environmental intervention study of the impact of urban soil lead abatement on children's blood lead levels. lead-contaminated soil abatement was associated with a modest reduction in children's blood lead levels in both phases of the project; however, the reduction in phase ii was somewhat greater than that in phase i. the combined results from both phases suggest that a soil lead reduction of 2060 ppm is associated with a 2.25 to 2.70 micrograms/dl decline in blood lead levels. low levels of soil recontamination 1 to 2 years following abatement indicate that the intervention is persistent, at least over the short-term. furthermore, the intervention appears to benefit most children since no measurable differences in efficacy were observed for starting blood and soil lead level, race, neighborhood, gender, and many other characteristics. however, soil abatement did appear to be more beneficial to children in the higher socioeconomic classes, with low baseline ferritin levels, and who spent time away from home on a regular basis and lived in nonowner occupied housing, and with adults who had lead-related hobbies and almost always washed their hands before meals. children who lived in apartments with consistently elevated floor dust lead loading levels derived almost no benefit from the soil abatement. it was not possible to separate the effects of the variables that had a beneficial impact on efficacy because they were closely correlated and the number of subjects was small. we recommend that further research be conducted to identify subgroups of children to whom soil lead abatement might be targeted.",nongeographical,massachusetts,0,Boston was mentioned but not Massachusetts,environment,abatement,NA
environmental lead and children's intelligence: a systematic review of the epidemiological evidence,"objectiveto quantify the magnitude of the relation between full scale iq in children aged 5 or more and their body burden of lead.designa systematic review of 26 epidemiological studies since 1979: prospective studies of birth cohorts, cross sectional studies of blood lead, and cross sectional studies of tooth lead.settinggeneral populations of children > or = 5 years.main outcome measuresfor each study, the regression coefficient of iq on lead, after adjustment for confounders when possible, was used to derive the estimated change in iq for a specific doubling of either blood or tooth lead.resultsthe five prospective studies with over 1100 children showed no association of cord blood lead or antenatal maternal blood lead with subsequent iq. blood lead at around age 2 had a small and significant inverse association with iq, somewhat greater than that for mean blood lead over the preschool years. the 14 cross sectional studies of blood lead with 3499 children showed a significant inverse association overall, but showed more variation in their results and their ability to allow for confounders. the seven cross sectional studies of tooth lead with 2095 children were more consistent in finding an inverse association, although the estimated magnitude was somewhat smaller. overall synthesis of this evidence, including a meta-analysis, indicates that a typical doubling of body lead burden (from 10 to 20 micrograms/dl (0.48 to 0.97 mumol/l) blood lead or from 5 to 10 micrograms/g tooth lead) is associated with a mean deficit in full scale iq of around 1-2 iq points.conclusionwhile low level lead exposure may cause a small iq deficit, other explanations need considering: are the published studies representative; is there inadequate allowance for confounders; are there selection biases in recruiting and following children; and do children of lower iq adopt behaviour which makes them more prone to lead uptake (reverse causality)? even if moderate increases in body lead burden adversely affect iq, a threshold below which there is negligible influence cannot currently be determined. because of these uncertainties, the degree of public health priority that should be devoted to detecting and reducing moderate increases in children's blood lead, compared with other important social detriments that impede children's development, needs careful consideration.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead levels in the household environment of children in 3 high-risk communities in california,"to assess environmental lead contamination in the household environment of children in high-risk areas of california, three urban locations were surveyed by the california department of health services. plant, soil, and dust lead levels were measured and a questionnaire was administered. this survey estimates that 3 million homes in california (27%) may have exterior paint lead levels greater than or equal to 5000 ppm, and 1.3 million homes (12%) may have interior paint lead levels greater than or equal to 5000 ppm. the highest concentrations of lead in paint were found on exterior surfaces and, for homes built between 1920 and 1959, on trim. age of housing was the best predictor of lead in soil and dust; homes built before 1920 were 10 times more likely to have soil lead levels greater than or equal to 500 ppm compared to post-1950 homes. most of the variability in dust lead levels could not be explained by factors measured in this survey. sources of lead in the home were more highly correlated with lead dust concentration levels than they were with lead dust loading levels. households with members reporting a lead job were twice as likely to have high dust lead levels compared to households with no one reporting a lead job. the significant differences in dust lead concentration levels between communities were not reflected in differences in dust lead loading levels. measuring dust lead loading levels does not appear to be a meaningful sampling method for risk assessment in the context of prioritizing abatement.

lead in house dust: relationships between exposure metrics,"this paper examines the quantitative relationships between dust loading, lead loading, and lead concentration in house dust. bare floor, interior sill, and carpet dust samples were collected in 216 jersey city, new jersey, homes using quantitative wipe and vacuum sampling techniques. comparison of wipe and vacuum sample distributions for these homes indicated that lead loading was more variable than dust loading or lead concentration measured on floors, sills, or carpets. these data also indicated that increased lead loading on carpets relative to sills or floors was due to higher dust loading on carpets. correlation analysis of wipe samples indicated that dust loading was more strongly correlated with lead loading on floors (r = 0.73) than on sills (r = 0.53), that dust loading was not correlated with lead concentration on either surface, and that lead loading and lead concentration were more strongly correlated in samples collected from sills (r = 0.81) than from floors (r = 0.65). most importantly, carpets and rugs served as large reservoirs for house dust and consequently were a large potential source of dust exposure in children's common microenvironments.

physiologically based models for bone-seeking elements. v. lead absorption and disposition in childhood,"a physiologically based model of lead absorption and disposition, previously developed and validated for adults, has been tested and calibrated for children. the model was modified to incorporate additional information on the age dependence of bone formation rate and to take into account increasing localization of bone modeling activity with age. a bone volume characterized by mature bone metabolic activity increases from zero at birth to the total bone volume by young adulthood. bone formation rate is high from childhood through adolescence, with peaks at birth and around puberty. bone resorption rate keeps pace at a rate that allows the orderly increase of bone mass. in general, the model reproduces childhood blood lead observations well, except in instances where lead is ingested at very high concentrations. both bone and blood lead concentration are labile during early childhood because of the high rate of bone turnover. they respond rapidly to increases in lead exposure, and decrease almost as rapidly to near-preexposure concentrations when exposure returns to background levels. as the child grows, fractional bone formation and resorption rates decline and total bone lead turnover becomes more sluggish. from the time of peak bone mineralization rate in adolescence into early adulthood, the rate of bone turnover drops dramatically and the ability to reverse bone lead accumulation relatively rapidly is lost.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

temporal aspects of risk characterization of lead,"temporal factors are an integral part of the components of the risk assessment: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure estimation. critical elements of risk characterization include expressions of uncertainty and variability in the data base describing toxicity, dose-response, and exposures to lead. over the past two decades our understanding of the mechanism(s) of action of lead has resulted in progressively lower quantities of lead being of concern. an increased level of certainty has developed over the past ten years on the nature of the adverse neurodevelopmental consequences of lead exposure. dose-response evaluation and accompanying risk characterization have been expressed by a number of organizations (e.g., a series of statements by public health authorities describing tolerable blood lead concentrations for children and adults, which have been lowered over time). blood lead concentrations of concern for young children have decreased over time from greater than or equal to 40 mu g/dl to, greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dl. expression of the hazard of lead to the nervous system is dependent upon the developmental period in which lead exposure occurs. based on available data, lead exposures in utero are considered a far greater hazard to the nervous system than are lead exposures that occur later in development. over the past two decades lead exposures have decreased markedly, reflecting virtual elimination of lead solder from food processing and phase-out of leaded fuel additives from gasoline. lead-based paints in housing remain the major source of lead for young children in the united states. greater clarification of the rime period needed to assess lead exposures associated with adverse neurobehavioral effects is a current goal of risk characterization.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

a longitudinal-study of chronic lead-exposure and physical growth in boston children,"we investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between chronic exposure to lead and physical growth among a cohort of children reassessed 13 years after initial examination. we measured weight, height, and dentin lead levels of 270 children in 1975-78. in 1989-1390 we reexamined 79 of these children for measurement of weight, height, and bone lead levels by means of irt vivo k x-ray fluorescence. to avoid potential confounding by race and chelation history, analysis was restricted to white subjects without a history of lead chelation therapy. a total of 236 subjects provided complete information for the study of cross-sectional relationship between dentin lead levels and physical growth: 58 subjects for the study of longitudinal relationship between dentin lead levels and changes in physical growth and 54 subjects for che study of longitudinal relationship between bone lead levels and changes in physical growth. dentin lead levels averaged 14.9 mu g/g; tibia and patella lead levels averaged 1.2 and 5.0 mu g/g, respectively. with control for potential confounders including age, sex, baseline body size, and mother's socioeconomic status, log(10) dentin lead level was positively associated with body mass index as of 1375-1978 (beta = 1.02, p = 0.03) and increase in body mass index between 1975-78 and 1989-90 (beta = 2.65, p = 0.03). bone lead levels were not significantly associated with physical growth. this is the first study relating chronic lead exposure to body mass index. the results suggest that chronic lead exposure in childhood may result in obesity that persists into adulthood.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
can household pets be used as reliable monitors of lead-exposure to humans,"we investigated the validity of dogs and cats as sentinels of environmental lead exposure to humans. this paper reports findings from a study conducted in granite city, il, during the summer of 1991. at this site, a former secondary lead smelter had been in activity for more than 80 years. the smelter was shut down in 1982. the surrounding area was found to be contaminated with lead, with soil lead concentrations above 5000 ppm in some places. the illinois department of public health conducted a survey in the community to determine the effects of lead on the local population. we sampled dogs and cats owned by these people. our results suggest that living near a closed lead smelter, with heavy soil contamination, was not associated with high blood lead concentrations in pets, or their owners. there was a significant relationship between blc (blood lead concentrations), in indoor pets and younger children, which was consistent with our hypothesis that pets could be used to monitor childhood lead exposure. we also found that, when there was one pet with a high blc in a house, the likelihood of finding one person with a blc above 10 mu g/dl was significantly increased.",nongeographical,illinois,0,Mentions IL abbreviation but not full state name,environment,exposure surrogate,NA

prevalence of childhood lead poisoning in a lead mining area,"this study investigated the prevalence of lead poisoning among children six to seventy-one months of age who live in a lead mining area, compared to children not living in an area exposed to lead mining waste. children were selected from a sampling frame based on a census of the study and control areas. participants were interviewed and blood and urine were collected for lead and cadmium analysis. environmental measurements of soil, dust, and paint were also made. mean blood lead levels were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group, 6.25 mu g/dl and 3.59 mu g/dl, respectively. also, 14% of the study group compared to 0% of the control group had blood lead levels greater than 10 mu g/dl, the level of concern established by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). soil, dust, and paint lead levels were significantly higher in the study area. there were no significant differences between groups in urine cadmium levels although environmental dust and soil cadmium levels were significantly higher in the study group. this study suggests that the increased prevalence of elevated blood levels in the study group is highly correlated to a combination of exposure to soil contaminated with lead mining and smelting waste and exposure to household lead paint.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead testing of children and homes: results of a national telephone survey,"objectives. this study was designed to estimate the percentage of young children in the united states who have been tested for lead and the percentage of dwellings in the united states in which the paint has been tested for lead. methods. a national random digit dial telephone survey of 5238 households was conducted in 1994. weighted national estimates and 95% confidence intervals for outcomes of interest were calculated. results. about 24% of u.s, children ages 0 to 6 years were estimated to have been tested for lead. higher rates of testing were reported for children living in homes constructed prior to 1960, those living in homes with low household income, those living in rental units, and those living in the northeast. lead paint testing was performed for only an estimated 9% of u.s. housing units. older homes were not more likely to have been tested than newer ones. conclusion. a high proportion of pre-school children have apparently not been screened for lead exposure, even among subgroups at increased risk most dwellings of pre-school children have not been tested for lead paint. these data suggest that most at-risk children are not being reached by current approaches to lead poisoning prevention.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
obtaining information about susceptibility from the epidemiological literature,"whether people become ill after encountering environmental pollutants depends on the magnitude of their exposure and their capacity to respond. exposure and intrinsic response capabilities vary within the population. those that become ill when the general population remains largely unaffected are considered to be highly susceptible. the u.s. environmental protection agency (usepa), responsible for protecting the public from environmental pollutants, has developed risk assessment procedures to assist in evaluating the likelihood of health effects. however, the agency's ability to evaluate the risk faced by highly susceptible populations is often hindered by the paucity of adequate health effects data. response variability can be assessed with animal models and human epidemiological studies. although animal models are useful when evaluating the effect of gender and developmental stage on susceptibility, inbred rodent strains underestimate the genetic and lifestyle-induced variability in susceptibility found in human populations. epidemiological approaches are the preferred source of information on variability. this paper reviews the epidemiological literature from the perspective of a risk assessor seeking data suitable for estimating the risk to highly susceptible populations. epidemiological approaches do nor measure the full range of population response variability. rather, ''susceptibility factors'' are evaluated either as risk factors or by focusing on the susceptible population, e.g. children. susceptibility factors due to genetics, developmental stage, gender, ethnicity, disease state and lifestyle are most frequently encountered. often, the information describing the health impact of the susceptibility factor is incomplete due to, (1) a failure to consider factors modifying susceptibility; (2) inadequate exposure data; (3) a failure to evaluate the health impact of the susceptibility factor. in addition, for a given exposure agent, several susceptibility factors may be relevant. while incomplete data describing susceptibility factors limits the opportunity for quantitative estimations of risk, available information can supplement qualitative evaluations and risk management.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

blood lead screening practices among us pediatricians,"objectivein 1991, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) decreased the blood lead level of concern to 10 micrograms/dl (0.48 mumol/l) and recommended universal screening. because these guidelines continue to provoke controversy, we conducted a study to: 1) estimate the proportion of pediatricians who are members of the american academy of pediatrics (aap) who report screening for elevated blood lead levels; 2) describe their clinical practices regarding screening for elevated blood lead levels; 3) compare attitudes of universal screeners, selective screeners, and nonscreeners; and 4) identify characteristics of pediatricians who universally screen.designconfidential, cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative random sample of 1610 pediatricians conducted through the aap periodic survey.subjectsthe study included 1035 responders (64% response rate). analysis was limited to the 734 pediatricians who provide well-child care (ie, primary-care pediatricians).resultsfifty-three percent of pediatricians reported screening all their patients aged 9 to 36 months, 39% reported screening some, and 8% reported screening none. among those who screen, 96% use a blood lead assay. the primary risk factors for which selective screeners screen are: history of pica (94%); living in an older home with recent renovations (92%); living in an older home with peeling paint (93%); and having a sibling who had an elevated blood lead level (88%). among primary-care pediatricians, 73% agree that blood lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl should be considered elevated, and 16% disagree. however, 89% of primary-care pediatricians believe that epidemiologic studies should be performed to determine which communities have high proportions of children with elevated blood lead levels, and 34% of primary-care pediatricians believe that the costs of screening exceed the benefits.conclusionsthree years after the centers for disease control and prevention issued new guidelines for the management of elevated blood lead levels, a slight majority of primary-care pediatricians in the united states who are members of the aap report that they universally screen their appropriately aged patients, while most of the remaining pediatricians report screening high-risk patients. many pediatricians may want additional guidance about circumstances under which selective screening should be considered.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
moderate lead poisoning: trends in blood lead levels in unchelated children,"the appropriate clinical management of children who are moderately poisoned with lead (pb) is under active investigation. to determine the pattern of change in blood pb (bpb) levels in the absence of chelation therapy, we followed moderately pb-poisoned children (initial blood pb levels 1.21-2.66 mumol/l or 25-55 micrograms/dl) for 6 months with repeated bpb level measurements. chelation therapy was not administered because all the children had negative lead mobilization tests indicating limited response to the chelating agent, calcium disodium edetate (cana2edta). eligible children received the following interventions: notification of the health department to remediate lead hazards; reinforced educational efforts about the toxicity sources and treatment of pb during 10 clinic and 3 home visits; and iron therapy for children with ferritin levels less than 16 micrograms/l. to quantify the lead paint hazards in the home, we combined a visual rating of the surfaces (intact to peeling) with an x-ray fluorescence (xrf) measurement of the lead content of the painted surface. the sum of these assessments is termed the home environmental score (hes). data were analyzed from 79 children. bpb levels declined by 27%, on average, over 6 months. hes was correlated with bpb at enrollment, but neither the initial nor later hes measurements predicted bpb at other time points. the hes was highest at enrollment and declined by 50% and 75% at the second and third home visits, respectively. however, only a minority of the children (20%) achieved an hes of 0, indicating no lead paint hazards at home. despite some ongoing pb exposure, a parallel fall in bpb levels was observed in subgroups of children with either initially low or high hes (above or below the median hes of 37). iron status did not account for the change in bpb levels. these data provide evidence that our measure, the hes, is quantifiably related to bpb levels in children, that this correlation is significant only prior to intervention; and that bpb levels decline in children who are moderately poisoned with pb after they are enrolled in a comprehensive intervention program, even in the absence of chelation therapy and in the presence of ongoing lead paint exposure and fe deficiency.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

the relationship between surface dust lead loadings on carpets and the blood lead of young children,"the final clean-up of residential lead abatement projects in federally-supported housing, as well as in other housing in a number of states, must meet surface dust lead clearance levels expressed as mu g of lead per square foot. these clearance levels were established because hand-to-mouth ingestion of lead-contaminated dust is recognised as a major pathway through which many children are exposed. a dilemma exists because many floors in housing undergoing abatement are carpeted and the established clearance levels are generally not recommended for use on carpets. these clearance levels are also used as 'action levels' to determine whether exposure reduction activities are needed. the us environmental protection agency is currently in the process of issuing standards for hazardous levels of lead in interior dust and bare soil under title x of the housing and community development act of 1992, 'the residential lead-based paint hazard reduction act of 1992'. an effort to develop a potential surface dust lead clearance level for carpets was made using an existing vacuum dust collection method that has previously been shown to be a reliable indicator of childhood lead exposure. this method was designed for use on carpeted and non-carpeted surfaces. using data from the cincinnati soil lead abatement demonstration project, the suggested floor-dust lead level where an estimated 95% of the population of children would be expected to have blood lead values below the national goal of 10 mu g dl(-1), was more than an order of magnitude lower than the current floor-dust lead clearance level of 1080 mu g m(-2) (100 mu g ft(-2)). further comparisons of blood lead and carpet lead levels in other parts of the country should be performed before a risk-based lead loading clearance level is established.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,"Cincinnati soil lead abatement mentioned, but I believe it is a reference data set",,,

stable lead isotope profiles in smelter and general urban communities: a comparison of environmental and blood measures,"high-precision lead isotope ratios and lead concentrations have been compared statistically and graphically in women of child-bearing age (n = 77) from two smelter communities and one general urban community to evaluate the relative contributions to blood lead of tissue lead stores and lead from the contemporaneous environment (soil, floor dust, indoor airborne dust, water, food). blood lead (pbb) contents were generally low (e.g. <10 mu g dl(-1)). statistically significant isotopic differences in blood and environmental samples were observed between the three cities although isotopic differences in blood for individual subjects living in close proximity (similar to 200 m radius) was as large as the differences within a city. no single environmental measure dominated the biological isotope profile and in many cases the low levels of blood lead meant that their isotopic profiles could be easily perturbed by relatively small changes of environmental exposure. apportioning of sources using lead isotopes is possibly not feasible, nor cost effective, when blood lead levels are <5 mu g dl(-1). interpretations based on statistical analyses of city-wide data do not give the same conclusions as when the houses are considered individually. aggregating data from multiple subjects in a study such as this obscures potentially useful information. most of the measures employed in this study, and many other similar studies, are markers of only short-to-medium integration of lead exposure. serial sampling of blood and longer sampling times, especially for household variables, should provide more meaningful information.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
blood lead levels in a continuity clinic population,"introduction: lead toxicity is well recognized as a significant cause of morbidity in children, especially those under the age of six years. while lead toxicity has not been recognized as a public health problem in houston, it is possible that children in the area suffer from low-level lead effects on the central nervous system. objectives: to detect asymptomatic cases of lead toxicity in one population of houston children and to assess the effectiveness of the lead risk questionnaire. design: venous blood samples for quantitative lead were analyzed utilizing the anodic stripping voltameter. the centers for disease control's lead risk assessment questionnaire was administered to each patient. setting: baylor college of medicine continuity clinic at texas children's hospital. subjects: all patients, ages 9-72 months, seen for routine care between december 1992 and june 1994 were screened once. results: blood lead levels were obtained on 801 children; all but 47 completed lead risk questionnaires. the mean age of the study group was 2.37 years (sd 1.84) and they were 54% male. they were 39% hispanic, 39% black, and 18% white. eighty-eight percent reported an annual income of < $20,000. they lived in 127 separate zip codes. twenty-five (3.1%) patients had elevated blood lead, 21 between 10-14 micrograms/dl and 4 between 15-19 micrograms/dl. no patients had blood lead levels of > or = 20 micrograms/dl. no statistically significant differences were found between patients with blood lead < 10 micrograms/dl and those with > or = 10 micrograms/dl when comparing for age, sex, ethnicity, income, and zip code. only those children living in or regularly visiting a pre-1960 home with peeling or chipping paint were significantly more likely to have elevated blood lead (p = .045). conclusion: although the majority of children in our setting were poor and urban, the prevalence of blood lead > or = 10 micrograms/dl was 3.1%, well below the estimated 17% quoted by the centers for disease control in recommending stringent screening guidelines. the lead risk assessment questionnaire failed to identify 32% of children with elevated blood lead levels. since this questionnaire is critical to screening populations at low risk for lead toxicity, it is important to determine whether a revised questionnaire or a more careful elicitation of parental responses will improve identification of those children at risk.",texas,texas,1,,screening,screening,NA
census tract analysis of lead exposure in rhode island children,"there has been increasing interest in a targeted approach to the screening and prevention of lead exposure in children. targeted screening requires an understanding of variation in lead exposure in individual children or by region. in order to better understand variation by region, we studied rhode island lead poisoning screening data, examining average lead exposure to children living in 136 providence county census tracts (cts). the study population included 17,956 children aged 59 months and under, who were screened between may 1, 1992, and april 30, 1993. we evaluated the relationship between the percentage of children with blood lead greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dl (pe10) and sociodemographic and housing characteristics, derived from united states 1990 census data, of these cts. ct descriptors included population density, percentage of households receiving public assistance income, median per capita income, percentage of households female headed, percentage of houses owner occupied, percentage of houses built before 1950, percentage of houses vacant, percentage of population black, percentage of recent immigrants, and intraurban mobility. on average, 109 children were screened in each census tract; mean screening rate was 44%. there was wide variation in average lead exposure among census tracts, with pe10 ranging from 3 to 60% of screened children (mean 27%). individual census variables explained between 24 and 67% of the variance in pe10 among cts. a multiple regression model including percentage screened, percentage of households receiving public assistance, percentage of houses built before 1950. in (percentage of houses vacant), and percentage of recent immigrants explained 83% of variance in pe10. the percentage of houses built before 1950, a variable which models the presence of lead paint in old houses, displayed the largest adjusted effect on pe10 over the range observed for that variable in ri cts. the percentage of houses vacant was also a highly significant and robust predictor; we suggest that vacancy is an ecological marker for the deterioration of lead-based paint, with higher vacancy neighborhoods containing houses in poorer condition. in rhode island, census tracts with high vacancy rates also have high rates of recent immigration, making immigrant groups vulnerable to lead exposure. small-areas analysis may be useful in directing resources to high risk areas, explaining the sociocultural forces which produce such exposure and analyzing the effects of housing policy over time in states with high screening penetration.

prenatal care and infant lead exposure,"objective: the objective of the study was to determine the relation between prenatal care of mothers and blood lead concentrations in their offspring in the first year of life. methods: a retrospective survey was conducted of 200 predominantly black infants between the ages of 6 and 22 months (mean age, 13.4 months). the infants had been screened for the first time since birth at the charleston county (south carolina) health department. they resided in a neighborhood with the highest prevalence of lead poisoning in charleston. prenatal care use data were obtained after matching birth records with lead-screening records. results: seventy-three infants (37%) had blood lead levels 0.48 micromol/l (> or = 10 microg/dl) or higher. adequacy of prenatal care, defined by the modified kessner index, showed 11% with intensive care (26% of these with high lead levels), 39% with adequate care (35% high blood lead levels), 35% with intermediate care (40% with high blood lead levels), 13% with inadequate care (42% with high blood lead levels), and 2% with no prenatal care (25% with high blood lead levels). with the exception of the small group with no prenatal care (n = 4), the proportion of infants with a high blood lead level was inversely proportional to the level of care. the logistic regression model that best fit the data included age at screen for lead and birth weight. low birth weight babies (<2500 gm) were more likely to have a high blood lead level at primary screen than babies who were heavier at birth (odds ratio, 2.60; p = 0.04), and the older the baby at screening, the greater the likelihood of a high blood lead level (odds ratio, 1.23; p = 0.01). there was a trend for black infants to have a high blood lead level more often than white infants (odds ratio, 3.05; p = 0.06). conclusions: less than adequate use of prenatal care may reflect an increase in risk factors contributing to lead exposure in infancy. low birth weight also was related to high blood lead levels. further studies are required to differentiate among several hypotheses for this effect. intrauterine lead exposure, which is known to reduce birth weight, may contribute to measured blood lead levels at first screen. alternatively, low birth weight may increase lead absorption and retention in infancy or may increase risk of lead exposure.",south carolina,south carolina,1,,maternity,prenatal,NA
"targeted screening for childhood lead exposure in a low prevalence area--salt lake county, utah, 1995-1996","during 1991-1994, an estimated 930,000 u.s. children aged < 6 years had blood lead levels (blls) > or = 10 micrograms/dl, and the risk for an elevated bll was greatest among children who were non-hispanic black or mexican american, from low-income families, living in large metropolitan areas, or living in housing built before 1946. because risk for lead exposure is associated with several different factors, it can vary greatly across relatively small areas. to establish the local prevalence and distribution of childhood lead exposure and develop local blood lead screening recommendations, the salt lake city-county health department (slcchd) offered free blood lead screening to all children aged 12-36 months enrolled at the seven special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (wic) clinics in salt lake county, utah (1995 population: 812,000), during january-october 1995. this report presents findings of the screenings at wic clinics, describes the design and promotion of local targeted screening recommendations, and describes the resulting increases in appropriate bll screenings among children.",utah,utah,1,,screening,screening,NA
pesticide exposures to children from california's central valley: results of a pilot study,"in response to concerns about pesticide use and evidence that contaminants may accumulate in house dust, the california department of health services (dhs) conducted a pilot study of pesticide contamination in rural children's home environments. house dust samples for pesticide analysis were collected from eleven homes, five of which had at least one farmworker (fw) resident. handwipe samples were collected from one child at each residence (ages 1-3 years). ten of 33 pesticides tested in house dust were detected. excluding non-detects, concentrations for diazinon ranged from 0.7-169 ppm in four fw homes and 0.2-2.5 ppm in three non-farmworker (nfw) homes (overall median = 1 ppm), suggesting a difference between fw and nfw homes. chlorpyrifos ranged from 0.2-33 ppm in three fw homes and < 1 ppm in two nfw homes (overall median < 0.5 ppm). all other pesticides were detected at < 2 ppm at four or fewer homes. the sources of these compounds could not be determined. co-located samples were considerably different in concentration and lending, indicating intra-household variation. of nine compounds tested, diazinon and chlorpyrifos were found on the hands of two or three fw children (20-220 ng/hand). dust ingestion scenarios show child exposures could exceed the united states environmental protection agency office of pesticide program diazinon chronic reference dose (9 x 10(5) mg/kg/day). the results suggested that pesticide residues are present in the home environment of some california children and are likely to contribute to exposures. additional research is feasible and needed to assess the magnitude and distribution of these risks.",california,california,1,,environment,residential,NA
statewide assessment of lead poisoning and exposure risk among children receiving medicaid services in alaska,"objective: lead poisoning is a well-recognized public health concern for children living in the united states. in 1992, health care financing administration (hcfa) regulations required lead poisoning risk assessment and blood lead testing for all medicaid-enrolled children ages 6 months to 6 years. this study estimated the prevalence of blood lead levels (blls) >/=10 microg/dl (>/=0.48 micromol/l) and the performance of risk assessment questions among children receiving medicaid services in alaska. design: measurement of venous blls in a statewide sample of children and risk assessment using a questionnaire modified from hcfa sample questions. setting: eight urban areas and 25 rural villages throughout alaska. patients: nine hundred sixty-seven children enrolled in medicaid, representing a 6% sample of 6-month- to 6-year-old alaska children enrolled in medicaid. outcome measure(s): determination of bll and responses to verbal-risk assessment questions. results: blls ranged from <1 microg/dl (<0.048 micromol/l) to 21 microg/dl (1.01 micromol/l) (median, 2.0 microg/dl or 0.096 micromol/l). the geometric mean blls for rural and urban children were 2.2 microg/dl (0.106 micromol/l) and 1.5 microg/dl (0.072 micromol/l), respectively. six (0.6%) children had a bll >/=10 microg/dl; only one child had a bll >/=10 microg/dl (11 microg/dl or 0.53 micromol/l) on retesting. children whose parents responded positively to at least one risk factor question were more likely to have a bll >/=10 microg/dl (prevalence ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 26.6); the predictive value of a positive response was <1%. conclusions: in this population, the prevalence of lead exposure was very low (0.6%); only one child tested (0.1%) maintained a bll >/=10 microg/dl on confirmatory testing; no children were identified who needed individual medical or environmental management for lead exposure. universal lead screening for medicaid-enrolled children is not an effective use of public health resources in alaska. our findings identify an example of the importance in considering local and regional differences when formulating screening recommendations and regulations, and continually reevaluating the usefulness of federal regulations.",alaska,alaska,1,,sociodemographic,screening,NA
lead poisoning and associated risk factors among preschoolers enrolled in a head start program,"despite the fact that lead poisoning is one of the most common pediatric health problems in the united states today, little is known about the prevalence and correlates of this disease among nonurban preschool children living in the southern united states. the purpose of this study was to measure the prevalence of abnormal lead levels and to explore the relationships between lead levels and gender, weight, hemoglobin, and ethnicity. using a chart review protocol, data were collected from 81 charts of children enrolled in a head start program in florida. the prevalence rate of elevated lead levels was 18.5%, a rate higher than that found in most previous research. no relationship was found between lead levels and gender, weight, hemoglobin, and ethnicity. the results highlight the importance of local screening efforts. controversies in screening are discussed in this article in some detail with the aim of assisting health care providers make decisions about whether universal screening for lead levels in children is appropriate and whether use of the centers for disease control questionnaire has sufficient value. further study is needed regarding prevalence rates in different geographic areas in the united states, and factors associated with elevated lead levels.",florida,florida,1,,sociodemographic,screening,NA

quantitative modeling of lead exposure from glazed ceramic pottery in childhood lead poisoning cases,"the us epa's integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model is a physiologically-based, multi-compartment model which simulates lead uptake, distribution within the body, and elimination in order to predict children's blood lead levels. this study used the ieubk to quantify the relative importance of dietary lead exposure from ceramic bean pots (as opposed to other environmental sources including soil, water, air and indoor dust) in children from san diego county, ca, the majority of whom had been identified (by actual measurements) to have elevated blood lead levels. the eubk modeling suggested that dietary lead exposure from beans prepared in mexican pottery may account for a major fraction of the blood lead burden in children (all of hispanic ethnicity) whose families used such ceramic ware. the ieubk model tended to be overpredictive of actual values for blood lead levels, but this was most probably due to uncertainties in the exposure variables in the risk assessment. the results of this model simulation emphasize the need, in a geographic and ethnic setting such as san diego county, for specific interventions including education and outreach programs for those at risk.",california,california,1,,environment,diet,NA
associations between soil lead and childhood blood lead in urban new orleans and rural lafourche parish of louisiana,"this study evaluates associations between soil lead concentrations (spb), age of housing, and blood lead levels (bpb) of children in metropolitan new orleans and lafourche parish, louisiana. the database includes over 2,600 spb and 6,000 bpb samples paired by their median values and pre-1940 housing percentages for 172 census tracts. associations were evaluated with fisher's exact test and spearman's rho test and modeled with the least sum of absolute deviations regression. census tracts with low spb are associated with new housing, but census tracts with high spb are evenly split between old and new housing [fisher's exact test, p = 8.60 x 10(-13) for the percentage of housing built before 1940 (percent pre-1940 housing) versus spb]. the p-value for spb versus bpb is 12 orders of magnitude stronger than the p-value for percent pre-1940 housing versus bpb. census tracts with low bpb are associated with new housing, but census tracts with high bpb are split evenly between old and new housing (fisher's exact test, p = 1. 67 x 10(-12) for percent pre-1940 housing versus bpb). census tracts with high spb are associated with high bpb and census tracts with low spb are associated with low bpb (fisher's exact test, p = 3.18 x 10(-24) for bpb versus spb). the spearman's rho test of the association of spb and bpb in orleans and lafourche parishes yielded a p-value of 6.12 x 10(-24). the least sum of absolute deviations regression model of the data is bpb = 1. 845 + 0.7215 (spb)0.4. a comparison of the modeled bpb versus observed bpb has an r(2) of 0.552 and a p-value of 2.83 x 10(-23) that this relation was due to chance. if blood lead in children is more closely associated to soil lead than to the age of housing, then primary lead prevention should also include soil lead.",louisiana,louisiana,1,,environment,residential,outdoor
childhood lead poisoning and vinyl miniblind exposure,"objective: to determine the contribution of vinyl miniblinds to childhood lead poisoning. design: a descriptive investigation was undertaken to estimate attributable risk among all reported childhood lead poisoning cases in north carolina for which home environmental sampling was conducted between march and august 1996. participants: ninety-two children, aged 6 to 72 months, identified through a statewide screening program were included. blood lead and environmental sampling test results were obtained from routine surveillance data collected for all lead-poisoned children. results: exposure to vinyl miniblinds with dust lead levels of 100 mu g/ft(2) or more occurred for 44 (48%) of the lead-poisoned children; 25 (27%) of the children were exposed to levels of 500 mu g/ft(2) or more. vinyl miniblinds were the predominant source tie, other major sources of lead were not identified) for 8 (9%) of the children. overall, the median dust lead level for vinyl miniblind field samples was 590 mu g/ft(2), and the highest level reported was 73 302 mu g/ft(2). even new vinyl miniblinds manufactured before july 1996 contained dust lead levels that on average exceeded 100 mu g/ft(2). the levels for recently available nonleaded vinyl miniblinds were below the limits of detection. conclusions: vinyl miniblinds, introduced into this country 10 years ago, with sales estimated at 30 million sets a year, include brands containing lead. although new formulations with no lead added are available, millions of children may still be at risk because a product recall has not been issued tie, lead-contaminated vinyl miniblinds are still in general use). in addition, the risk assessment evaluations proposed in lieu of universal blood lead screening for low-risk communities could overlook children with exposure to this source.",north carolina,north carolina,1,,structure,residential,indoor

the failure of cdc screening questionnaire to efficiently detect elevated lead levels in a rural population of children,"background: in 1991, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) lowered the level for lead toxicity from 25 micrograms/dl to 10 micrograms/dl and published guidelines recommending that all children be tested for blood lead level at 12 months of age and again, if possible, at 24 months. the guidelines also called for periodic universal screening of children between the ages of 6 and 72 months using the cdc's lead screening questionnaire. however, blindly following these recommendations may result in unnecessary patient discomfort, wasted time, and extra expense. according to the cdc guidelines, deviation from this practice requires the determination of the local prevalence of lead poisoning. the purpose of this study was to measure the local prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (ebll) and to assess the utility of the cdc's lead screening questionnaire in a rural setting. methods: three hundred seventy-six children living on the navajo reservation in arizona were studied. a consecutive series evaluation at well-child visits between the ages of 6 and 72 months was conducted using the cdc lead screening questionnaire and blood lead levels measured by anodic voltammetry. results: of 376 children, 368 had their blood levels tested. eight children tested positively with an ebll of > or = 10 micrograms/dl for a prevalence of 2.2%. three hundred twenty-three completed questionnaires; 83 (25.7%) of these children had false-positive results. the sensitivity and specificity of the cdc lead screening questionnaire were 42.9% and 73.7%, respectively. the positive predictive value of the questionnaire was 3.5%. conclusions: in this rural population of children, the prevalence of lead poisoning was low, and the cdc lead screening questionnaire failed to efficiently identify those children with lead toxicity. screening such a population using the cdc guidelines will result in unnecessary discomfort for children and will squander limited resources of time and money. physicians who care for children should know the local prevalence of ebll in order to effectively follow the cdc's recommendations for lead screening.",arizona,arizona,1,,screening,screening,NA

lead concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood in areas with high and low air pollution,"the lead concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood were determined in 50 parturient women at delivery. twenty-five lived in agricultural areas with low air pollution and 25 lived in urban areas with high air pollution. the mean lead concentrations (mean +/- sd) in maternal and umbilical cord blood and the correlation coefficient of mothers from urban areas with high air pollution were 37.2 +/- 4.7 ng/ml, 20 +/- 3.4 ng/ml and r = 57, respectively. the mean lead concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood and the correlation coefficient of mothers from agricultural areas with low air pollution were 20.5 +/- 5.6 ng/ml, 12.9 +/- 3.6 ng/ml and r = 0.70, respectively. our results show that the difference in mean lead concentration between the blood of mothers both from urban and agricultural areas and the blood from the umbilical cords of their newborns was statistically significant (p < 0.001). the factors that control the transfer of lead from the mother's blood to the fetus are the quantity of the element in the mother's blood and the placenta itself which has a dynamic protective function that is amplified when maternal blood lead levels are raised.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
validation of a self-administered lead exposure questionnaire among suburban teenagers,"teenagers represent a unique population in which to evaluate lead exposure. a self-administered questionnaire was developed to evaluate the current and historic lead exposures of teenagers. this work evaluates the exposure questionnaire for both its ability to predict lead exposure and the accuracy of the teenage respondents. subjects received the survey at school and were instructed to get assistance from their parents in questionnaire completion. environmental samples (dust, soil, and water) were collected from 30 suburban boston homes to evaluate the questionnaire's predictiveness. to evaluate the accuracy of subjects' responses, independent information about housing was obtained. the questionnaire was effective in identifying predictors of dust and soil lead levels, but not for water lead levels. fine dust lead loading (<150 mu m) varied significantly among the six housing age categories (pre-1940, 1940-1949, 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, and >1979) and traffic levels. fine dust lead concentrations varied significantly with decade of housing construction. mean soil lead levels varied significantly among housing age categories, traffic levels, and exterior construction materials. for the important predictors, there was excellent agreement between the teenagers' self-report and confirmatory information. for housing age categories, the observed agreement was 69%; for traffic level, the observed agreement was 88%. these results illustrate that questionnaires continue to be useful in evaluating home lead levels even in suburban homes and that teenagers are accurate respondents.

preventing lead poisoning in children,"lead poisoning is the most significant and prevalent disease of environmental origin among us children. despite over 100 years' knowledge of the special hazards of lead exposure for young children, it has taken over a century for effective primary prevention to be adopted. obstacles to primary prevention have included deliberate campaigns by industry to prevent restrictions upon such uses on lead as plumbing, paints, and gasoline additives; influence of industrial support of biomedical research at major us medical schools: lack of appropriate policy mechanisms to identify and control lead exposures; and opposition to investing resources in lead poisoning prevention. the removal of lead from gasoline, which began in the united states in 1972 and was completed in 1995, has resulted in almost fourfold reductions in median blood lead levels in us children from 1976 to 1991. increased screening and interventions to identify and abate lead sources, such as lead in housing, also contributed to this major public health success. nevertheless, lead exposures remain prevalent, although increasingly less generally distributed. perhaps because of the renewed """"ghettoization"""" of lead, support for lead poisoning prevention has waned. objections to investing public and private resources in screening and source abatement have challenged the continuing commitment of public health officials to prevention. the demonstrable success and social benefits of preventing lead toxicity are cited in support of continued preventive health policies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"update: blood lead levels--united states, 1991-1994","lead is an environmental toxicant that may deleteriously affect the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and reproductive systems. lead exposure in young children is a particular hazard because children absorb lead more readily than do adults and because the developing nervous systems of children are more susceptible to the effects of lead. blood lead levels (blls) at least as low as 10 micrograms/dl can adversely affect the behavior and development of children. cdc's national health and nutrition examination surveys (nhanes), an ongoing series of national examinations of the health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, have been the primary source for monitoring blls in the u.s. population. from nhanes ii (conducted during 1976-1980) to phase 1 of nhanes iii (conducted during october 1988-september 1991), the geometric mean (gm) bll for persons aged 1-74 years declined from 12.8 micrograms/dl, and the prevalence of elevated blls (blls > or = 10 micrograms/dl) decreased from 77.8% to 4.4%. this report updates national bll estimated with data from phase 2 of nhanes iii (conducted during october 1991-september 1994), which indicate that blls in the u.s. population aged > or = 1 year continued to decrease and that blls among children aged 1-5 years were more likely to be elevated among those who were poor, non-hispanic black, living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

effects of maternal cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on blood lead levels of newborns,"the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cigarette smoking (active and passive exposure) and alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cord blood lead levels. in 1990, a survey was conducted in two hospitals in québec city, québec, canada, a white-collar agglomeration. the sample included 430 mothers and their newborns. information on the lifestyles of mothers during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaire. cord blood lead concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. a dose-response relation was found between cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption of mothers and cord blood lead levels. an average increase of about 15 percent (0.013 mumol/liter) in cord blood lead levels was estimated for every 10 cigarettes smoked per day. mean blood lead levels in babies whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy but who drank alcohol moderately was 17 percent higher than those of nonsmoking mothers who abstained from alcohol intake. multivariate analyses revealed that both cigarette smoking and alcohol intake make significant and independent contributions to cord blood lead concentrations. lifestyles of pregnant women thus appear to play an important role in the prenatal lead exposure of newborns. because of the potential effects of lead exposure on pregnancy outcomes, our study provides further arguments to support public health advisories concerning the harmful effect of smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
log-additive versus log-linear analysis of lead-contaminated house dust and children's blood-lead levels. implications for residential dust-lead standards,"the environmental protection agency has been mandated to develop a health-based standard for lead in residential dwellings in the united states. prior estimates of the relationship between residential dust-lead levels and children's blood-lead concentrations have usually been obtained by using a log-linear regression of blood-lead concentration on levels of lead-contaminated house dust. it remains unknown, however, whether the log-linear model or a frequently cited alternative, the log-additive model, is the preferable regression method for analyzing these data. secondary analysis of the lead-in-dust study data was undertaken to compare log-additive with log-linear regression analysis for the purpose of developing a health-based dust lead standard. specifically, we were interested in comparing the log-additive and log-linear analyses in their ability to characterize adequately the relationship of dust-lead loading on various surfaces with blood-lead concentrations among urban children and to develop a predictive model to estimate the risk that a child will develop an elevated blood-lead level on the basis of a known level of dust lead. we used two dust sampling methods, the baltimore repair and maintenance (brm) vacuum method and the wipe method, to compare the log-linear and log-additive models. the log-linear model was consistently superior to the log-additive model in its ability to explain the variability in the observed blood-lead concentrations of the studied children, for both the wipe sampler and the brm sampler. in addition, the log-additive model often predicted only a limited increase in the probability of blood-lead concentrations exceeding 10 micrograms/dl as a result of doubling the dust-lead loading exposure, whereas the log-linear model consistently demonstrated a significant increase in the probability of blood-lead concentrations exceeding 10 micrograms/dl. brm lead loading explained additional variability in blood lead above and beyond that explained by wipe loading for both carpeted and uncarpeted floors. in contrast, wipe-lead loading explained significant additional variability after adjustment for brm loading for both uncarpeted floors and interior window sills. although brm loading better predicted children's blood-lead concentrations than did wipe loading, these differences were not statistically significant. we conclude that the log-linear model explained a greater percentage of the variability in blood-lead concentrations than did the log-additive model, indicating that the log-linear model should be the default model of choice for developing a dust-lead standard.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

elevated lead contamination in homes of construction workers,"national institute for occupational safety and health investigators studied lead exposures among 37 families of construction workers; 22 neighborhood families with no known lead exposures were included for comparison. workers were identified as having blood lead levels at or above 25 micrograms/dl. this article reports the levels of lead contamination on hands and interior surfaces of homes and automobiles of study participants. results indicate that the hands of lead-exposed workers were seven times more contaminated with lead compared with control workers; no difference was found between exposed and control family members' hands. surface lead contamination was significantly higher in automobiles driven by the lead-exposed workers; some locations, such as armrests, were 10 times more contaminated for the exposed group. high lead loadings in lead workers' automobiles were found on the driver's floor (geometric mean [gm] = 1100 micrograms/m2), driver's armrest (2000 micrograms/m2), and passenger's armrest (1200 micrograms/m2). surface lead concentrations were significantly higher for exposed homes compared with control homes in rooms where work clothing was changed (gm = 370 versus 120 ppm; p = 0.005). while environmental sources of lead were also evaluated, study results strongly suggest that construction workers' occupational exposures together with poor hygiene practices were the primary causes of lead contamination. requirements intended to prevent """"take-home"""" lead exposures were reported by workers in this study to be infrequently followed by employers. these findings may be limited in representativeness since only highly exposed workers were selected from a specific geographic area. regardless, targeted education and enforcement efforts are necessary to help ensure that preventive measures are adequately practiced throughout the construction industry.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
a framework to guide public health assessment decisions at lead sites,"the agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr) provides health consultations and assessments at hazardous waste sites. many of these sites have potentially significant levels of lead contamination for which the agency must assess the health implications of exposure. typically, environmental data are used to predict blood lend (pbb) levels in order to determine at which sites, if any, follow-up action is needed estimating blood lead levels from environmental lead concentrations, however, can be problematic. several approaches have been developed, including classical ingestion rate determinations and comparison to animal studies, prevalence studies extrapolated to comparable sites, regression analysis of known exposure followed by slope factor estimates of similar levels of exposure, and the environmental protection agency's (usepa) integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model (ieubk). uncertainty is attendant to each of these approaches due, in part, to the limited nature of the environmental sampling data and the various site-specific factors. in this manuscript we describe an approach atsdr developed to utilize regression analysis with multiroute uptake parameters to estimate blood lead levels in children.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the critical role of house dust in understanding the hazards posed by contaminated soils,"the health risks posed by soil pollutants are generally thought to be due to soil ingestion and have often resulted in massive regulatory efforts to remedy such contamination. the contribution of this route to the actual human health hazard has been questioned, however as soil removal alone seems to have little influence on the body burdens of soil contaminants in exposed individuals. ongoing research also has repeatedly and substantially reduced the estimates of soil ingested daily. because comparatively little time is spent outdoors by most individuals, exposure to soil brought indoors, present as house dust, is now thought to be nearly as important as the direct ingestion of soil. exposure via house dust has not been studied specifically, but several observations suggest that it may be important. dust is largely composed of fine particles of tracked-in soil. the smaller dust particles cling to surfaces better than soil, and contaminant concentrations are often higher in house dust. fine particles are likely to be more bioavailable, and degradation is slower indoors. contaminants thus may be concentrated and more readily available in the areas most frequented. in some studies, contaminant levels in dust are correlated more closely with body burdens of contaminants than other sources, suggesting that this route should be considered when assessing risks from soil. until more research addressing exposure to dust is conducted recommendations for assessing potential health risks from this pathway are provided.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

maintenance of elevated lead levels in drinking water from occasional use and potential impact on blood leads in children,"the variation in lead concentration was measured by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry isotope dilution in household tap water throughout the day when the plumbing system was not fully flushed. after collection of an initial 125-ml water sample containing 119 micrograms/l and a 2-l sample, 125-ml samples were collected at hourly intervals for 8 h. the concentrations in the hourly samples remained in the range 35-52 micrograms/l compared with 1.7 micrograms/l for fully flushed water. high precision lead isotopic measurements showed that approximately 50% of the lead in these water samples derives from the tap 'housing' compared with the overall household system. a health risk assessment was performed employing the us environmental protection agency integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model. predicted blood lead levels in infants only exceeded the 'levels of concern' of 10 micrograms/dl when 100% of the water consumed contained 100 micrograms pb/1. it would appear that unless the infant consumed 100% of first flush water at lead concentrations of approximately 100 micrograms/l, the blood lead would not exceed the recommended 'level of concern'. however, if more than 0.51 was consumed in drinks and formulae using first flush water, then the blood lead could easily exceed the recommended level. likewise, a pregnant mother could be at risk of consuming considerably more than the 0.51/day first flush water of the concentrations measured, or throughout the day, if the system were not fully flushed.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"effect of lead on fetal growth in a canadian smelter city, 1961-1990","the fetuses of women who live adjacent to a large lead smelter may experience intrauterine growth retardation that results from the mothers' systemic availability of lead absorbed from their environment. in this study, the authors used 30 y of birth records (n = 9329) to obtain fetal growth measurements for the smelter city and a suitable control city. the authors determined rates of intrauterine growth retardation (small-for-date births) for 5-y periods, and they determined the estimated relative risk of intrauterine growth retardation that occurred in the smelter city and compared it with the control city. the risk of intrauterine growth retardation for women in the smelter city was not significantly greater (odds ratio = 0.83) for either the 30-y period or each of the 5-y periods (odds ratio range = 0.51-1.33). the authors concluded that fetal growth was not affected by the amount of lead absorbed by women who lived in a smelter environment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
childhood lead poisoning on the us-mexico border: a case study in environmental health nursing lead poisoning,"human exposure to environmental hazards is a major public health problem along the us-mexico border due to socioeconomic, cultural and political factors. childhood lead exposure is endemic in areas of extreme poverty and substandard housing. hispanic children of indigent, poorly-educated, disenfranchised families are at disproportionate risk. risk management is contingent upon consideration of the interrelationships between socioeconomics, politics, and culture. this case study explains childhood lead poisoning in a colonia family living at subsistence level from such a perspective. the purpose of the study was to identify, explain, and ameliorate lead exposure pathways. case study methodology was used to support or refute the proposition that these children were exposed to occupational lead. the children were the study sampling unit and the family a subunit. an embedded single case explanatory design was appropriate. data were collected from exposure surveys, environmental and blood specimens, and review of medical records. pattern-matching and explanation-building techniques were used to analyze data. the study illustrated how extreme poverty, lack of access to health services, social isolation, language and legal barriers, and hazardous occupations may be singularly common risk factors for hispanic children on the us-mexico border. the study is pertinent to public health nurses who work with this population.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,US-Mexico border,,,
lead poisoning--one approach to a problem that won't go away,"a reduction in sources of environmental lead exposure has resulted in substantial declines in mean blood lead concentrations of all age groups in the united states. however, some segments of the population continue to have unacceptable levels of lead exposure and elevated blood lead concentrations. in addition, virtually all residents of industrialized countries have bone lead stores that are several orders of magnitude greater than those of our preindustrial ancestors. recent studies suggest that these skeletal lead stores adversely affect health and can contribute to reduced birth weights, aggressive behavior in children, and anemia, hypertension, and kidney disease in adults. evidence is described that demonstrates that an increase in dietary calcium consumption can reduce lead absorption and toxicity from exogenous and endogenous lead exposure. a relatively inexpensive and effective way to reduce the substantial morbidity that will result from widespread lead exposure is by fortification of a variety of foods with low levels of calcium. this approach can complement other efforts to prevent lead exposure and reduce lead toxicity.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the relationship of lead in soil to lead in blood and implications for standard setting,"as part of a soil lead regulation process, this review was conducted to determine the association between lead in soil and established human health effects of lead or validated biomarkers of lead exposure. we reviewed only studies where soil exposure could be distinguished from other sources of lead and whose design could reasonably be used to infer a causal relationship between soil lead and either biomarkers or health effects. no such studies of health effects were found. studies describing a quantitative relationship between soil lead and blood lead did meet our criteria: 22 cross-sectional studies in areas with polluted soil; and three prospective studies of soil lead pollution abatement trials. the cross-sectional studies indicated that, compared to children exposed to soil lead levels of 100 ppm, those exposed to levels of 1000 ppm had mean blood lead concentrations 1.10-1.86 times higher and those exposed to soil lead levels of 2000 ppm had blood lead concentrations 1.13-2.25 times higher. the prospective studies showed effects within the ranges predicted by the cross-sectional studies. differences in results between studies were surprisingly modest and likely explainable by random sampling error, different explanatory variables included in data analyses and differences in methods of measuring lead in environmental specimens.

position paper of the american council on science and health: lead and human health,"the potential human health risk of lead in the environment remains a topic of current debate and concern. given sufficient exposure, lead can exert severe and chronic health effects. today, due to successful efforts to reduce the commercial use of lead and control its release to the environment, lead """"poisoning"""" is uncommon in our society. blood-lead levels among the u.s. population, including those of children, have decreased dramatically over the past decade and according to current surveillance programs continue to decline. because lead poisoning among children is no longer as prevalent as it once was, the focus has shifted to the long-term effects lead may exert on the intellectual development of children. continued toxicological and epidemiological research will expand the understanding of this important facet of the lead issue. trace levels of lead in consumer products remain a low health risk to humans, despite the fear and uncertainty which often accompany such concerns. future efforts to reduce lead exposure should be aimed at high-risk groups which include the socioeconomically disadvantaged and certain minority sectors of the population. through educational programs, improvement in personal hygiene practices, and abatement of lead-containing paint (when warranted), blood lead levels should continue to decline, reducing the health risk to lead in the environment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

the effectiveness of a home cleaning intervention strategy in reducing potential dust and lead exposures,"the changes in dust loading, lead loading and lead concentration, determined from vacuum samples and wipe samples collected during the childhood lead exposure assessment and reduction study (clears) were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the cleaning protocol in homes of children found to have moderate lead poisoning, e.g. levels between 10-20 mu g/dl. the samples were collected at least twice, and in 65 homes three times, during the course of a year long intervention in homes where half were randomized into a group which received a standardized lead intervention program for lead reduction, and the other homes only received an accident intervention program. the homes with lead burdened children were located in hudson county, new jersey (primarily in jersey city), and were referred to the clears by a number of private and public sources. each home had wipe sampling conducted with the lww sampler (patented), and vacuum sampling was completed using a device described by wang et al. in applied occupational and environmental hygiene. the results were compared in two ways: (1) between the two intervention groups, and (2) over the time course of the intervention period. when compared to the values seen in the first visit vacuum sampling results showed statistically significant decreases in lead loading and dust loading by the third sampling visit for the lead intervention homes. substantial reductions in lead loading and dust loading were also seen when the lend intervention values were compared to values obtained in the accident intervention homes over the course of the year long intervention. the wipe sampling results for the 65 homes with three visits found no significant reductions in dust loading and lead loading among any of the room surfaces sampled in the accident intervention homes. there were 75% and 50% reductions observed on the window sills and on the bedroom floors of the homes which participated in the lead intervention. the levels in the living room and the kitchen showed very little change in loadings. this appeared to be due to the fact these rooms were near a background or baseline value of 0.3 g/cm(2) and 0.12 mg/cm(2) for dust loading and lead, respectively. this was substantiated by the window sills and bedroom wipe sampling results since each surface approached these values by the third visit. significant reductions in lead concentrations found in the wipe samples from the intervention homes appeared to be related to the absence of historically active sources of lead in these homes, rather than elimination of current sources. the results of the micro-environmental sampling program in clears indicated that a year-long cleaning protocol can significantly decrease lead levels in rugs and on other exposed surfaces. this will reduce the potential for exposure to lead among the occupants, especially children, that come in contact with such surfaces.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,dust,residential,indoor

prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in an inner-city pediatric clinic population,"in november 1997, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) released revised guidelines for lead poisoning screening, including a recommendation that states and regions individualize screening policies based on local prevalence of elevated lead levels. the purpose of this study was to collect prevalence data for a philadelphia, pennsylvania, inner-city pediatric outpatient population previously not known to have elevated blood lead levels in order to determine its risk for lead exposure and screening requirements. charts were reviewed for 817 children of 10 months through 6 years of age whose venous blood lead levels were obtained as part of their routine health care over a 12-month period ending october 1992. none of these children had a history of previously elevated lead levels. prevalence of elevated lead levels was determined for this population and correlated with patient age, sex, race, and insurance type. more than two-thirds (68%) of the study patients had a blood lead level of [greater than and equal to]10 microg/dl. elevated blood lead levels were associated with black race (p<0.0001), but not with sex or insurance type. the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels was highest at ages 37-48 months. a majority of the children screened had lead levels in excess of the cdc threshold for an abnormal lead level (10 microgram/dl). this is the highest reported prevalence within a u.s. pediatric clinic population. in view of this extremely high prevalence, clinicians and public health personnel caring for children in philadelphia inner-city clinics must follow the intent of the new cdc guidelines by increasing their efforts in the areas of screening, follow-up, and environmental interventions. to ensure a lead-safe upbringing for children in the united states, state health officials nationwide should perform local risk assessments before considering policy transitions from universal to targeted screening.",pennsylvania,pennsylvania,1,,screening,screening,NA

isotopic ratio analysis in residential lead-based paint and associated surficial dust,"objectives: this investigation assessed the contribution of lead in lead-based paint (7 samples) to lead-laden dust (8 samples) in a single suburban vacant residence using isotopic ratio analysis, methods: interior/exterior lead-based paint surface concentration was measured by x-ray fluorescence while dust and scrapings were analyzed chemically for total lead content and by mass spectrometry for the associated isotopic ratios. results: four out of 5 comparisons of paint (7 samples) and dust (8 samples) for a given location did not match isotopically, in the one location where the isotopic ratio of the paint and dust samples matched closely, some portions of the paint were not intact. one explanation for the isotopic ratio match is that the dust sample may have actually been contaminated with paint flecks. this explanation appears likely since the isotopic ratio for the lead in the dust and paint sample were not in the modern average range of us environmental lead, strongly indicating a local point source of the lead in this dust sample, namely the paint at this location. lead dust samples whose isotopic ratio lies in the modern average range for us environmental lead cannot be correlated to the paint which is beneath them, since the isotopic ratio of lead in the dust may actually be a composite of many sources of lead over time, as suggested by an isotopic ratio in the modern average range. conclusions: from the samples from this one house, the data dispute the contention that intact lead-based paint chalks and creates lead-contaminated dust on its surface. while leaded household dust may contribute to children's lead exposure, intact paint need not contribute to surficial lead-laden dust. isotopic ratio measurements can be useful for point-source determination by virtue of sample match and by placement of the ratio on the spectrum of isotopic ratio values for lead. point-source assessment based on isotopic ratio was either strengthened or weakened by placement outside or within the average range for us environmental lead, respectively.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
chemical mass balance source apportionment of lead in house dust,"chemical mass balance was used to apportion the major proximate contributors of lead mass to house dust (hdpb) obtained from urban jersey city, nj, homes of children at risk for lead exposure. coarse (up to similar to 60 mu m) and pm10 ( <10 mu m) particle size fractions of vacuum dust samples from 64 residences with lead-based paints were analyzed for ph and 16 other elements. source profiles were developed to represent proximate source media contributors to hdpb pre-1960 interior lead-based paints, indoor air, and a crustal source profile that accounted for the contribution of yard soils and street dusts. on average for both size fractions the exterior proximate sources, i.e., crustal materials and deposited airborne particulates, were responsible for approximately two-thirds of the hdpb mass; the interior lead-based paint sources contributed the remaining third. results indicate considerable variability in pb source contributors between homes, but little difference in the source contributors to the two overlapping size fractions within homes. effective reduction of hdpb levels will require control of both exterior and interior sources.",nongeographical,new jersey,0,New Jersy mentioned as NJ,dust,residential,both

lead levels in high-risk and low-risk young children in the minneapolis-st paul metropolitan area,"objectives: to determine distribution of lead levels among children in a low-risk area; to validate a prescreening questionnaire; and to determine if universal lead screening is necessary in children in this area. design: blood lead levels and questionnaires were obtained on eligible patients. data were analyzed using stepwise regression analysis. setting: community clinics and a health maintenance organization (hmo) in the minneapolis-st paul metropolitan area. patients: a total of 9603 children at well-child visits, age 6 months to 6 years at community clinics, and 6 months to 3 years at the hmo. outcome measures: whole blood lead levels (wbls) and questionnaires. results: the total sample rate of wbls at >/=10 microg/dl was 12%, at >/=15 microg/dl was 31/2%, and at >/=20 microg/dl was 1.2%. at both 10 microg/dl and 15 microg/dl, the non-hmo group was at higher risk. for both groups, risk factors included living in the central cities, and living in housing built before 1950. for the non-hmo group a history of the child eating paint chips, or the child or a sibling having previous lead poisoning were also risk factors. conclusions: not all children need lead screening. children living in the central cities, or with the risk factors of living in housing built before 1950 or a previous history of lead poisoning should be screened.",nongeographical,minnesota,0,Minneapolis-St. Paul mentioned,sociodemographic,screening,NA
effect of interventions on children's blood lead levels,"trail, canada, has been the site of an active lead/zinc smelter for nearly a century. since 1991, the trail community lead task force has carried out blood lead screening, case management, education programs targeted at early childhood groups and the general community, community dust abatement, exposure pathways studies, and remedial trials. from 1989 through 1996, average blood lead levels of children tested for the first time declined at an average rate of 0.6 microg/dl/year, while blood lead levels in canadian children not living near point sources appeared to be leveling off following the phase-out of leaded gasoline. since there was no concurrent improvement in local environmental conditions during this time, it is possible that the continuing decline in trail blood lead levels has been at least partly due to community-wide intervention programs. one year follow-up of children whose families received in-home educational visits, as well as assistance with home-based dust control measures, found that these specific interventions produced average blood lead changes of +0.5- -4.0 microg/dl, with statistically significant declines in 3 years out of 5. education and dust control, particularly actions targeted toward higher risk children, appear to have served as effective and appropriate interim remedial measures while major source control measures have been implemented at the smelter site.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
environmental exposures to lead and urban children's blood lead levels,"lead-contaminated water, soil, and paint have been recognized as potential sources of children's lead exposure for decades, but their contributions to lead intake among urban children remain poorly defined. this analysis was undertaken to estimate the relationship of environmental lead exposures to lead intake among a random sample of urban children, adjusted for exposure to lead-contaminated house dust. analyses of 183 urban children enrolled in a random sample, cross sectional study were conducted. children's blood and multiple measures of household dust, water, soil, and paint were analyzed for lead, and interviews were conducted to ascertain risk factors for childhood lead exposure. environmental sources of lead, including house-dust, soil lead, and water lead, were independently associated with children's blood lead levels. in contrast, paint lead levels did not have a significant effect on blood lead levels after adjusting for other environmental exposures. an increase in water lead concentration from background levels to 0.015 mg/l, the current epa water lead standard, was associated with an increase of 13.7% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead concentration exceeding 10 micrograms/dl; increasing soil lead concentration from background to 400 micrograms/g was estimated to produce an increase of 11.6% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead level exceeding 10 micrograms/dl, and increasing dust lead loading from background to 200 micrograms/ft2 is estimated to produce an increase of 23.3% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead level exceeding 10 micrograms/dl. these data support the promulgation of health-based standards for lead-contaminated dust and soil and the progressive lowering of standards for lead-contaminated water as the definition of undue lead exposure has been modified.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"lead consumption of 18- to 36-month-old children as determined from duplicate diet collections: nutrient intakes, blood lead levels, and effects on growth","objective: to determine the amount of lead ingested in food by means of duplicate diet collections, nutrient intakes, and anthropometric measurements of young children. design: once a month for a year, data were collected from 24-hour duplicate diets, hand wipes, a dust index, and anthropometric measurements. quarterly, venous blood samples were obtained. thermal ionization spectrometry by means of a lead-205 tracer was used to determine lead present in food, blood, and the hand wipes. a dust index was determined on the basis of observation of dust on surfaces in the home. anthropometric measurements obtained were height, weight, head circumference, and mid-upper arm circumference. subjects/setting: subjects were 21 children, aged 18 to 36 months, who resided in homes located in an urban area with potentially high lead levels. main outcomes measured: lead contamination in food and on hands, and blood lead values, were determined. statistical analysis performed: pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine relationships between lead content in food, blood, and hand wipes and growth. multiple regression analyses examined the effect of food types and dust lead on lead levels in food, and the effect of these variables on head circumference. results: mean blood levels were 0.3089 +/- 0.1496 micromol/l; 12 samples contained more than 0.4826 micromol/l. total intake of lead from food was 4.95 microg/day and ranged from 1.10 to -22.10 microg/day. more than a fourth of the diets collected exceeded 6.00 microg/day. foods considered home prepared were moderately related to blood lead level, and the dust index and hand wipe lead levels were related to total food lead. home-handled foods, canned foods, and hand-wipe lead were significant predictors of the lead content in food. a negative relationship was found between head circumference and blood lead level. applications: level of lead in food was directly related to hand-wipe lead. this finding underscores the need for dietitians and other health professionals to stress the importance of cleanliness in environments that are potentially lead contaminated. appropriate hand washing and surface cleaning should be emphasized when preparing and consuming food. the inverse relationship between head circumference and blood lead levels points to the need for additional studies to validate this finding while controlling for other extraneous variables.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
cdc's lead screening guidance: a systematic approach to more effective screening,"childhood lead poisoning is a major preventable environmental health problem in the united states. since the mid-1970s, there has been major progress in eliminating or reducing lead in gasoline, food cans, new house paint, and conduits of drinking water. ongoing screening programs led by health departments have identified children with elevated blood lead levels (blls) and provided them with environmental, medical, and other services to limit the health impact of lead exposure. as a result of these efforts to reduce sources of lead and to identify lead poisoned children, there was a decrease of more than 80% in the blls of the u.s. population between 1976, when the first national survey of blls was conducted, and 1994, when the most recent national survey was completed. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has issued five guidance documents on preventing childhood lead poisoning - in 1975, 1978, 1985, 1991, and 1997 - basing each document on new scientific and practical information. for example, in several successive documents cdc lowered the threshold bll of concern because of new information on the health effects of low levels of lead exposure. although cdc guidelines have mainly been aimed at individual practitioners and health departments involved in secondary prevention activities, each has also emphasized the need for more primary prevention activities.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

screening for elevated blood lead levels,"although recent data continue to demonstrate a decline in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (blls) in children, lead remains a common, preventable, environmental health threat. because recent epidemiologic data have shown that lead exposure is still common in certain communities in the united states, the centers for disease control and prevention recently issued new guidelines endorsing universal screening in areas with greater than or equal to 27% of housing built before 1950 and in populations in which the percentage of 1- and 2-year-olds with elevated blls is greater than or equal to 12%. for children living in other areas, the centers for disease control and prevention recommends targeted screening based on risk-assessment during specified pediatric visits. in this statement, the american academy of pediatrics supports these new guidelines and provides an update on screening for elevated blls. the american academy of pediatrics recommends that pediatricians continue to provide anticipatory guidance to parents in an effort to prevent lead exposure (primary prevention). additionally, pediatricians should increase their efforts to screen children at risk for lead exposure to find those with elevated blls (secondary prevention).",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead poisoning from an unexpected source in a 4-month-old infant,"childhood lead poisoning is characteristically a disease that occurs between the second and third years of life, generally resulting from the child's ingestion of lead-based paint or dust. however, lead poisoning may also appear in the first year of life. the case of a 4-month-old infant is reported in which the preparation of infant formula in a lead-soldered samovar (urn) resulted in venous blood lead levels as high as 46 microg/dl. the samovar had been brought into the united states by the parents while on a visit to iran. the infant was placed on chelation therapy with parenteral cana2edta followed by oral meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa) and d-penicillamine. this resulted in a rapid and substantial reduction in the blood lead level. lead poisoning in infancy may have unusual etiologies such as in utero transmission of lead by lead-poisoned women. because sources of lead poisoning in infancy may be unusual, a detailed environmental investigation may be necessary to identify the exact source. children exposed to lead in the first 2 years of life have a special vulnerability to the neurotoxicity of lead, with the risk of enduring developmental handicaps. continued public health initiatives to remove lead from the environment, in conjunction with routine lead screening of young children, will be key in meeting the goal of the centers for disease control and prevention to eliminate childhood lead poisoning by the year 2011.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
comparison of three models for predicting blood lead levels in children: episodic exposures to lead,"a threshold blood lead level in children below which no adverse effects occur has not been identified (cdc, 1991), therefore, the traditional risk assessment method of relating dose to a reference dose (rfd) for noncancer effects is not applicable to lead. to assess whether environmental lead concentrations may result in adverse health effects, predicted blood lead levels are compared to a blood lead level of 10 micrograms/dl, the current centers for disease control and prevention level of concern. children's blood lead levels may be predicted with one of at least three models: usepa's integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model (ieubk), and models by o'flaherty (1993) and carlisle and wade (1992). this paper explores the utility of these models for predicting blood lead levels in children, and discusses areas of uncertainty associated with the use of these models in evaluating episodic exposures. it is hoped that this discussion will stimulate interest further researching exposure and health effects from episodic contact with lead contaminated media.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

neurotoxicity in young adults 20 years after childhood exposure to lead: the bunker hill experience,"objectives-an epidemiological study of young adults was conducted to determine whether environmental exposure to lead during childhood was associated with current adverse neurobehavioural effects. methods-the exposed group consisted of 281 young adults who had been exposed environmentally to lead as children and the unexposed referent group consisted of 287 age and sex frequency matched subjects. information on demographics, past and current health, and past exposures to neurotoxicants, and responses to the swedish q16 questionnaire were collected by interview. standard neurobehavioural and neurophysiological tests were administered by computer or trained technicians. k x ray fluorescence was used to estimate tibial bone lead concentrations among the exposed and unexposed groups. associations were examined between the exposed group and referents and tibial bone lead concentration and the neurobehavioural and neurophysiological outcomes of interest. results-among the measures of peripheral nerve function, after controlling for confounders, sural sensory nerve evoked response amplitude, peroneal motor nerve compound motor action potential amplitude, vibrotactile thresholds of fingers and toes, and standing steadiness were significantly associated with exposure group. among the neurobehavioural tests, hand-eye coordination, simple reaction time latency, trails b latency, symbol digit latency, serial digit, and learning error score were also significantly associated with exposure group after controlling for confounders. exposed subjects had significantly more neuropsychiatric symptoms than the referents. associations between tibial bone lead concentration and scores for vocabulary, vibrotactile thresholds of the fingers, and vibrotactile thresholds of the toes approached significance. conclusions-significant adverse central and peripheral neurological effects were found in a group of young adults 20 years after childhood environmental exposure to lead when compared with non-exposed controls. the absence of a significant association between neurological outcomes and tibial bone lead concentration, and the presence of significant associations between neurological outcomes and exposure group may be due to either the magnitude of measurement uncertainty in k lt. ray films relative to the actual tibial bone lead concentration in these young non-occupationally exposed subjects, or uncontrolled confounding of the exposure group.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"relationships of lead in breast milk to lead in blood, urine, and diet of the infant and mother","we have obtained stable lead isotope and lead concentration data from a longitudinal study of mobilization of lead from the maternal skeleton during pregnancy and lactation and in which the newly born infants were monitored for 6 months postpartum to evaluate the effects of the local environment on lead body burden of the infant. samples of maternal and infant blood, urine, and diet and especially breast milk were measured for 21 mothers and 24 infants. blood lead concentrations were less than 5 mu g/dl in all except one subject. the mean lead concentration in breast milk +/- standard deviation was 0.73 +/- 0.70 mu g/kg. in seven subjects for whom serial breast milk sampling was possible, the lead concentration varied by factors of from 2 to 4, and for three subjects there was an increase at or after 90 days postpartum. for the first 60-90 days postpartum, the contribution from breast milk to blood lead in the infants varied from 36 to 80%. multiple linear regress;on analyses indicated statistically significant relationships for some of the variables of isotope ratios and lead concentrations between breast milk, blood, urine, and diet for infants and mothers. for example, the analyses revealed that both a mother's breast milk pb-207/pb-206 and pb-206/pb-204 ratios and lead concentration provide information to predict her infant's blood pb-207/pb-206 and pb-206/pb-204 ratios. the major sources of lead in breast milk are from the maternal bone and diet. an evaluation of breast milk lead concentrations published over the last 15 years indicates that studies in which the ratio of lead concentrations in breast milk to lead concentrations in whole maternal blood (x100) were greater than 15 should be viewed with caution because of potential contamination during sampling and/or laboratory analyses. selected studies also appear to show a linear relationship between breast milk and maternal whole blood, with the percentage of lead in breast milk compared with whole blood of <3% in subjects with blood lead levels ranging from 2 to 34 mu g/dl. the levels of lead in breast milk are thus similar to those in plasma. breast-fed infants are only at risk if the mother is exposed to high concentrations of contaminants either from endogenous sources such as the skeleton or exogenous sources.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

improved lead isotope ratio measurements in environmental and biological samples with a double focussing magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (icp-ms),"a method to measure lead (pb) isotope ratios in biological and environmental samples using a single collector double focussing magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (icp-ms) is presented. this. method is intercalibrated with multicollector thermal ionization mass spectrometry (tims) to assess the suitability of the icp-ms method for accurately and precisely identifying sources of environmental pb exposure to humans. results indicate that the external measurement precision (reproducibility) of this method, as evaluated by repeated analyses of the pb isotope standard nbs 981 over the course of a year, was <0.1% (1 sigma) for pb-206:pb-204, pb-207:pb-206 and pb-208:pb-206 ratios. accuracy of isotope ratio measurements by icp-ms was evaluated by comparing analyses of whole blood (biological) and household dust (environmental) samples with the definitive tims analyses of the same samples. for whole blood and dust samples, the pb-206:pb-204; pb-207:pb-206 and pb-208:pb-206 ratios measured by icp-ms and tims generally agreed to within twice the propagated standard deviation (2 sigma, sigma =root sigma(tims)(2) + sigma(icp-ms)(2)) of both methods. however. a small but systematic difference between the pb isotope ratios of blood measured with the two methods was apparent. the source of this difference remains under investigation. these data demonstrate that this icp-ms method provides improved accuracy and precision of lead isotope ratio measurements compared to previous icp ms methods, and is suitable for use in studies to evaluate sources of environmental pb exposure to children. further, the increased sample throughput and reduced cost of analyses using this method are substantial advantages over the more time-consuming and expensive tims method. consequently, this pb isotope methodology should prove useful as a routine tool in the investigation and mitigation of pb exposure associated hazards.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children: empirical comparisons with epidemiologic data,"the concept of model validation is evolving in the scientific community. this paper addresses the comparison of observed and predicted estimates as one component of model validation as applied to the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model for lead in children. the ieubk model is an exposure (dose)-response model that uses children's environmental lead exposures to estimate risk of elevated blood lead (typically > 10 micrograms/dl) through estimation of lead body burdens in a mass balance framework. we used residence-specific environmental lead measurements from three epidemiologic datasets as inputs for the ieubk model to predict blood lead levels, and compared these predictions with blood lead levels of children living at these residences. when the ieubk modeling focused on children with representative exposure measurements, that is, children who spent the bulk of their time near the locations sampled, there was reasonably close agreement between observed and predicted blood lead distributions in the three studies considered. geometric mean observed and predicted blood lead levels were within 0.7 microgram/dl, and proportions of study populations expected to be above 10 micrograms/dl were within 4% of those observed.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
cost-effectiveness analysis of lead poisoning screening strategies following the 1997 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention,"objective: to compare blood lead (bpb) poisoning screening strategies in light of the 1997 recommendations by the centers for disease control and prevention, atlanta, ga. design: cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health care system to compare the following 4 screening strategies: (1) universal screening of venous bpb levels; (2) universal screening of capillary bw levels; (3) targeted screening of venous bpb levels for those at risk; and (4) targeted screening of capillary bpb levels for those at risk; costs of follow-up testing and treatment were included in the model. results: only universal venous screening detected all bpb levels of at least 0.48 mu mol/l (10 mu g/dl). universal capillary screening detected between 93.2% and 95.5% of cases, depending on the prevalence of elevated bpb levels. targeted screening was the least sensitive strategy for detecting cases. venous testing identified between 77.3% and 77.9% of cases, and capillary testing detected between 72.7% and 72.8% of cases. in high-prevalence populations, universal venous screening minimized the cost per case ($490). in low- and medium-prevalence populations, targeted screening using venous testing minimized the cost per case ($729 and $556, respectively). in all populations, regardless of screening strategy, venous testing resulted in a lower cost per case than capillary testing. sensitivity analyses of all parameters in this model demonstrated that this conclusion is robust. conclusions: universal. screening detects all cases of lead poisoning and is the most cost-effective strategy in high-prevalence populations. in populations with lower prevalence, the cost per case detected using targeted screening is less than that of universal screening. the benefit of detecting a greater number of cases using universal screening must be weighed against the extra cost of screening. regardless of whether a strategy of universal or targeted screening is used, the cost per case using venous testing is less than that of capillary testing.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,"CDC office in GA mentioned, but not location for study focus",,,
predicting blood lead concentrations from lead in environmental media,"policy statements providing health and environmental criteria for blood lead (pbb) often give recommendations on an acceptable distribution of pbb concentrations such statements may recommend distributions of pbb concentrations including an upper range (e.g., maximum and/or 90th percentile values) and central tendency (e.g., mean and/or 50th percentile) of the pbb distribution. two major, and fundamentally dissimilar, methods to predict the distribution of pbb are currently in use: statistical analyses of epidemiologic data, and application of biokinetic models to environmental lead measurements to predict pbb. although biokinetic models may include a parameter to predict contribution of lead from bone (pbbone), contemporary data based on chemical analyses of pediatric bone samples are rare. dramatic decreases in environmental lead exposures over the past 15 years make questionable use of earlier data on pbbone concentrations to estimate a contribution of lead from bone; often used by physiologic modelers to predict pbb. x-ray fluorescent techniques estimating pbbone typically have an instrument-based quantitation limit that is too high for use with many young children. while these quantitation limits have improved during the late 1990s, pbbone estimates using an epidemiologic approach to describing these limits for general populations of children may generate values lower than the instrument's quantitation limit. additional problems that occur in predicting pbb from environmental lead by biokinetic modeling include a) uncertainty regarding the fractional lead absorption by young children; b) questions of bioavailabilty of specific environmental sources of lead; and c) variability in fractional absorption values over a range of exposures. additional sources of variability in lead exposures that affect predictions of pbb from models include differences in the prevalence of such child behaviors as intensity of hand-to-mouth activity and pica. in contrast with these sources of uncertainty and variability affecting physiologic modeling of pbb distributions, epidemiologic data reporting pbb values obtained by chemical analyses of blood samples avoid these problems but raise other issues about the validity of the representation of the subsample for the overall population of concern. stare and local health department screening programs and/or medical evaluation of individual children provide pbb data that contribute to databases describing the impact of environmental sources on pbb. overall, application of epidemiologic models involves fewer uncertainties and more readily reflects variability in pbb than does current stare-of-the-art biokinetic modeling.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
what do parents know about lead poisoning? the chicago lead knowledge test,"objectives: to examine the extent of parental knowledge about lead poisoning and its prevention and to determine characteristics associated with accurate lead knowledge. setting: twenty-three pediatric practices and 1 family practice in chicago, ill, and its suburbs. methods: a 24-question test regarding lead poisoning and its prevention (chicago lead knowledge test) was developed based on lead specialists' review and parental test-retest reliability. one point was assigned for each correct response. it was self-administered by a sample of 2225 parents of 0- to 6-year-old children visiting study practices. a 1-way analysis of variance (anova) was used to determine the association of demographic descriptors with test scores. results: respondents had a mean age of 33 years. ninety percent were mothers, 49% were college graduates, and 80% were home owners. fifteen percent lived in homes built before 1950, of which 36% were remodeled or renovated during the last 6 months. respondents' youngest children were 80% white, 10% hispanic, 5% african american, and 5% other. ten percent received medicaid and 86% had other medical insurance. thirty-four percent recalled receipt of lead information from a health care provider, and 2.4% had had a child with a blood lead level of 0.48 mu mol/l (10 mu g/dl) or higher. the mean chicago lead knowledge test score was 12.2 (sd, 3.7). questions related to lead exposure were more often answered correctly than those related to prevention and diet. in the anova model, those who recalled receipt of lead information from a health care provider, college graduates, respondents aged 30 years or older, hispanic respondents, and those living in homes built before 1950 had higher scores (all anova p less than or equal to .001). conclusions: parents do not have much knowledge of ways to prevent childhood lead poisoning. information from a health care provider can aid parental knowledge. the chicago lead knowledge test is a new self administered tool to help evaluate lead education programs.",nongeographical,illinois,0,Ill abbreviation used for Illinois,lead education,education,NA
childhood lead poisoning: the promise and abandonment of primary prevention,"in 1991, the public health service published the strategic plan for the elimination of childhood lead poisoning. this document marked a fundamental shift in federal policy from finding and treating lead-poisoned children to authentic primary prevention. it spelled out a 15-year strategy to achieve this goal and provided a cost benefit analysis showing that the monetized benefits far exceeded the costs of abatement. a strong national effort to eliminate the disease developed. now, 7 years after publication of the plan, primary prevention of lead exposure has been abandoned. this article examines the role of some prevailing attitudes and institutions in derailing the effort. some institutions-the lead industry, real estate interests, and insurance interests-behaved as anticipated. others, including private pediatricians, the american academy of pediatrics, some federal agencies, and a public interest group ostensibly dedicated to eliminating lead poisoning, also played an unexpected part in derailing the plan.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
an empirical comparison of lead exposure pathway models,"structural equation modeling is a statistical method for partitioning the variance in a set of interrelated multivariate outcomes into that which is due to direct, indirect, and covariate (exogenous) effects. despite this model's flexibility to handle different experimental designs, postulation of a causal chain among the endogenous variables and the points of influence of the covariates is required. this has motivated the researchers at the university of cincinnati department of environmental health to be guided by a theoretical model for movement of lead from distal sources (exterior soil or dust and paint lead) to proximal sources (interior dust lead) and then finally to biologic outcomes (handwipe and blood lead). the question of whether a single structural equation model built from proximity arguments can be applied to diverse populations observed in different communities with varying lead amounts, sources, and bioavailabilities is addressed in this article. this reanalysis involved data from 1855 children less than 72 months of age enrolled in 11 studies performed over approximately 15 years. data from children residing near former ore-processing sites were included in this reanalysis. a single model adequately fit the data from these 11 studies; however, the model needs to be flexible to include pathways that are not frequently observed. as expected, the more proximal sources of interior dust lead and handwipe lead were the most important predictors of blood lead; soil lead often had a number of indirect influences. a limited number of covariates were also isolated as usually affecting the endogenous lead variables. the blood lead levels surveyed at the ore-processing sites were comparable to and actually somewhat lower than those reported in the the third national health and nutrition examination survey. lessened bioavailability of the lead at certain of these sites is a probable reason for this finding.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,"University of Cincinnati mentioned, but not focus of study",,,
"science, socioenvironmental inequality, and childhood lead poisoning","studies of socioenvironmental inequality in the united states have focused primarily an adults as opposed to children, and they tend to neglect institutional conflicts over the production, dissemination, and encoding of scientific knowledge into policy relevant frameworks. drawing from public-health historical accounts, the medical literature on lead poisoning, the sociology of environmental conflicts, and studies of the production of scientific knowledge, this article addresses two questions: what is the sociopolitical basis of these conflicts' how did they affect the timing and capacity of national legislation to prevent lead poisoning from leaded gasoline the article concludes by finding that environmental-exposure studies shaped the definition of childhood lead poisoning as a national public-health problem. by analyzing scientific-knowledge production conflicts over the safety and health effects of leaded gasoline we can better understand the persistence of children's lead exposure as a basic socioenvironmental inequity.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the conceptual structure of the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children,"the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children was developed to provide plausible blood lead distributions corresponding to particular combinations of multimedia lead exposure. the model is based on a set of equations that convert lead exposure (expressed as micrograms per day) to blood lead concentration (expressed as micrograms per deciliter) by quantitatively mimicking the physiologic processes that determine blood lead concentration. the exposures from air, food, water, soil, and dust are modeled independently by several routes. amounts of lead absorbed are modeled independently for air, food, water, and soil/dust, then combined as a single input to the blood plasma reservoir of the body. lead in the blood plasma reservoir, which includes extracellular fluids, is mathematically allocated to ail tissues of the body using age-specific biokinetic parameters. the model calculation provides the estimate for blood lead concentration for that age. this value is treated as the geometric mean of possible values for a single child, or the geometric mean of expected values for a population of children exposed to the same lead concentrations. the distribution of blood lead concentrations about this geometric mean is estimated using a geometric standard deviation, typically 1.6, derived from the analysis of well-conducted community blood studies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

evaluation of risk assessment questions used to target blood lead screening in illinois,"objective: beginning in 1995, illinois law permitted targeted-as opposed to universal-blood lead screening in low-risk areas, which were defined by zip code characteristics. state guidelines recommended specific lead risk assessment questions to use when targeting screening. this study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of illinois lead risk assessment questions. design: parents bringing their 9- or 10- or 12-month and 24-month-old children for health supervision visits at 13 pediatric practices and parents of children (aged 6 through 25 months and who needed a blood lead test) receiving care at 5 local health departments completed a lead risk assessment questionnaire concerning their child. children had venous or capillary blood lead testing. venous confirmation results of children with a capillary level >/=10 micrograms/dl were used in analyses. children: there were 460 children with both blood and questionnaire data recruited at the pediatric practices (58% of eligible) and 285 children (51% of eligible) recruited at local health departments. of the 745 children studied, 738 provided a zip code that allowed their residence to be categorized as in a low-risk (n = 456) or high-risk (n = 282) area. results: sixteen children (3.5%) living in low-risk areas versus 34 children (12.1%) living in high-risk areas had a venous blood lead level (bll) >/=10 micrograms/dl; 1.8% and 5.3%, respectively, had a venous bll >/=15 micrograms/dl. for children living in low-risk areas, illinois mandated risk assessment questions (concerning ever resided in home built before 1960, exposure to renovation, and exposure to adult with a job or hobby involving lead) had a combined sensitivity of.75 for levels >/=10 micrograms/dl and.88 for levels >/=15 micrograms/dl; specificity was.39 and.39, respectively. the sensitivity of these questions was similar among children from high-risk areas; specificity decreased to.27 and.28, for blls >/=10 micrograms/dl and >/=15 micrograms/dl, respectively. the combination of items requiring respondents to list house age (built before 1950 considered high risk) and indicate exposure to renovation had a sensitivity among children from low-risk areas of.62 for blls >/=10 micrograms/dl with specificity of.57; sensitivity and specificity among high-risk area children were.82 and.36, respectively. for this strategy, similar sensitivities and specificities for low and high-risk areas were found for blls >/=15 micrograms/dl. conclusions: the illinois lead risk assessment questions identified most children with an elevated bll. using these questions, the majority of illinois children in low-risk areas will continue to need a blood lead test. this first example of a statewide screening strategy using zip code risk designation and risk assessment questions will need further refinement to limit numbers of children tested. in the interim, this strategy is a logical next step after universal screening.",illinois,illinois,1,,screening,screening,NA
a comparison of costs of universal versus targeted lead screening for young children,"the purposes of this study were to compare universal blood lead screening for young children versus targeting by a risk assessment questionnaire and to examine the cost implications of each approach. costs reflect the total number of blood tests required and cost of specimen collection, handling, and testing per elevated case. the setting included the metropolitan areas of minneapolis and st. paul, minnesota. children (n=9603) from 17 community organizations had blood tests. in addition, each child's parent or guardian completed a questionnaire assessing potential risk for lead poisoning. four different screening approaches are presented. each screening approach is presented with associated costs of overall screening and cost per child identified at blood levels of >/=10 microg/dl (n=1140) and >/=15 microg/dl (n=317). based on the screening strategy selected and an estimate of $17 per blood test, total screening costs ranged from $91,596 to $165,945. the cost per child identified with elevated lead levels ranged from $361 to $523 at >/=15 and $105 to $146 at >/=10. nine to 13% of children would not have been detected by policies other than universal screening. a geographically based approach was able to detect 90% of children with elevated blood levels at two-thirds the cost of universal screening. blood tests would be taken for all children living within city limits. those residing elsewhere would be tested only if answers to questionnaire items pertaining to age of housing, prior history of lead poisoning, or eating paint chips indicated risk. the new cdc guidelines suggest that screening be based on an assessment of housing, population demographics, and community risk and resources. this paper presents such an assessment.",minnesota,minnesota,1,,economic,screening,NA
primary prevention of childhood lead exposure: a randomized trial of dust control,"background: dust control is recommended as one of the primary strategies to prevent or control children's exposure to residential lead hazards, but the effect of dust control on children's blood lead levels is poorly understood. objective: to determine the effectiveness of dust control in preventing children's exposure to lead, as measured by blood lead levels, during their peak age of susceptibility. design: a randomized, controlled trial. setting: rochester, ny. participants: a total of 275 urban children were randomized at 6 months of age, of whom 246 (90%) were available for the 24-month-old follow-up visit. interventions: children and their families were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 140), which received cleaning equipment and up to eight visits by a dust control advisor, or a control group (n = 135). outcome measures: geometric mean blood lead levels and prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (ie, >10 microg/dl, 15 microg/dl, and 20 microg/dl). results: at baseline, children's geometric mean blood lead levels were 2.9 microg/dl (95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.7, 3.1); there were no significant differences in characteristics or lead exposure by group assignment, with the exception of water lead levels. for children in the intervention group, the mean number of visits by a dust control advisor during the 18-month study period was 6.2; 51 (36%) had 4 to 7 visits, and 69 (49%) had 8 visits. at 24 months of age, the geometric mean blood lead was 7.3 microg/dl (95% ci = 6.6, 8.2) for the intervention group and 7.8 microg/dl (95% ci = 6.9, 8. 7) for the control group. the percentage of children with a 24-month blood lead >/=10 microg/dl, >/=15 microg/dl, and >/=20 microg/dl was 31% versus 36%, 12% versus 14%, and 5% versus 7% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. conclusions: we conclude that dust control, as performed by families and in the absence of lead hazard controls to reduce ongoing contamination from lead-based paint, is not effective in the primary prevention of childhood lead exposure.",new york,new york,1,,dust,residential,indoor
a retrospective examination of in-home educational visits to reduce childhood lead levels,"a number of human health effects from lead are well known. however, the means for reducing lead exposure in children has been a subject of uncertainty. this paper presents results of a retrospective study of educational lead reduction interventions in milwaukee, wisconsin for children who had elevated blood lead levels between 20 and 24 microg/dl. the study examined milwaukee health department (mhd) records of baseline and follow-up blood lead measurements. a study group of children received an in-home educational visit by an mhd paraprofessional. the educational visits last about an hour and the importance of reducing lead exposure, nutritional suggestions, and dust clean-up practices and behavioral changes that can reduce lead exposure are discussed. after the intervention, the average observed blood lead level (n=187) declined by 4.2 microg/dl or by about 21%. a decline of 1.2 microg/dl (6%) was also observed in a reference group of 226 children who did not receive an mhd in-home visit. the decline in the reference group may be partially due to education at the clinics taking the blood samples. the study group had a decline in blood lead levels 3.1 microg/dl (15%) greater than the reference group, with the difference between groups being statistically significant with a p value of less than 0.001. although significant exposures remained in most of the children studied, important lead reductions were observed with this relatively inexpensive and simple intervention. education in the homes of families at risk for lead poisoning may be an effective component of programs to reduce blood lead levels.",wisconsin,wisconsin,1,,lead education,education,NA
childhood blood lead screening in arkansas: recommendations for health care providers,"multiple studies documenting regional differences in prevalence of elevated blood lead levels suggest that children are not at equal risk for lead exposure. in late 1997, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) published guidelines to help states and communities make decisions regarding screening practices. to apply these guidelines to arkansas department of health blood lead data for the 8,883 screens completed in state fiscal year 1997, along with 1990 census bureau housing and poverty statistics, were compiled and reviewed. based upon cdc criteria and other available information, conservative recommendations for blood lead screening are presented for each county in the state. lead toxicity in children remains a significant public health concern in certain regions of the country. between 1991-1994, it was estimated about 930,000 u.s. children one to five years old had lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl. children most at risk include minorities, those residing in large central cities, and those living in poverty. blood lead levels (bll's) as low as 10 micrograms/dl have been linked with possible iq deficits as well as learning and behavior problems. to date, no study has demonstrated benefit from reduction of blood lead levels in the 10-24 micrograms/dl range. nonetheless, in 1991 the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) published guidelines for screening and followup designed to detect lead levels this low, presumably in order to prevent additional exposure and perhaps shorten the duration of toxicity. these guidelines essentially called for universal screening of one- and two-year old children regardless of socioeconomic status or previous population-based results of lead screening in their locale. [table: see text] since release of the controversial 1991 guidelines, several reports of lead toxicity prevalence surveys from diverse communities have demonstrated extreme variation in the magnitude of the problem. for example, in 1994 only 0.6% of alaska medicaid recipients six years or younger had lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl, with the highest being 11 micrograms/dl.",NA,arkansas,0,,screening,sociodemographic,NA
dietary calcium intakes of urban children at risk of lead poisoning,"dietary calcium is well known to decrease gastrointestinal lead absorption and thereby reduce the risk for lead poisoning. because children in economically deprived urban centers are especially likely to have excessive lead exposure, we surveyed dietary calcium intakes of 314 children from the greater newark, new jersey, area. the areas of newark and adjacent communities studied had been previously identified as containing significant sources of environmental lead by geographic information systems technology. an abbreviated national cancer institute health habits and history questionnaire, modified to focus on foods high in calcium, was used to determine dietary calcium. calcium intakes were then compared to the new dietary reference intake (dri) guidelines. the respondents were primarily the parents of african-american and hispanic children ranging in age from 1 to 8 years, with a mean age of 3.5 years. the most recent blood lead concentration was 11.4 +/- 0.8 mu g/dl (mean +/- standard error), and 48.6% had concentrations at or above the current guideline of 10 mu g/dl. quintiles of calcium intake were: 221 +/- 13; 488 +/- 9; 720 +/- 6; 885 +/- 6; and 1,389 +/- 49 mg/day. fifty-five of 175 (31.4%) children aged 1-3 years had calcium intakes below the dri, as did 82 of 139 (59.0%) children aged 4-8 years. the percentage of mothers reporting lactose intolerance in their children was 2.5%. the observation that the children in the highest quintile easily exceeded the dris for calcium suggests that urban parents who include dairy foods in their childrens' meals can provide a diet that meets the dri guidelines. children in the lowest quintiles are at risk of increased absorption of the environmental lead to which they are inevitably exposed, as well as other problems associated with a low intake of dietary calcium. the data suggest that both lead exposure and low dietary calcium continue to pose significant health risks to urban minority children.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,nutrition,diet,NA
calculating the interindividual geometric standard deviation for use in the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children,"the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model, recommended for use by the u.s. environmental protection agency at residential superfund sites to predict potential risks to children from lead exposure and to establish lead remediation levels, requires an interindividual geometric standard deviation (gsd(i)) as an essential input parameter. the gsd(i) quantifies the variability of blood lead concentrations for children exposed to similar environmental concentrations of lead. estimates of potential risks are directly related to the gsdi, and therefore the gsd(i) directly impacts the scope of remediation at superfund sites. site-specific gsd(i) can be calculated for sites where blood lead and environmental lead have been measured. this paper uses data front blood and environmental lead studies conducted at the bingham creek and sandy, utah, superfund sites to calculate gsd(i) using regression modeling, box modeling, and structural equation modeling. gsd(i)s were calculated using various methods for treating values below the analytical method detection and quantitation limits. treatment of nonquantifiable blood lead concentrations affected the gsd(i) more than the statistical method used to calculate the gsd(i). for any given treatment, the different statistical methods produced similar gsd(i)s. because of the uncertainties associated with data in the blood lead studies, we recommend that a range of gsd(i)s be used when analyzing site-specific risks associated with exposure to environmental lead instead of a single estimate. because the different statistical methods produce similar gsd(i)s, we recommend a simple procedure to calculate site-specific gsd(i) from a scientifically sound blood and environmental lead study.",utah,utah,1,,biology,model,NA

national human exposure assessment survey (nhexas): exploratory survey of exposure among population subgroups in epa region v,"the national human exposure assessment survey (nhexas) provides a rich database of exposure and environmental measurements for persons living in epa region v (great lakes). demographics (e.g., gender, minority status, age, income, and year home built) between u.s. census data and the overall region v sample were compared and showed good agreement. this representative sample was used to conduct an exploratory investigation of selected subpopulations that might exhibit higher exposures, on average, to volatile organic chemicals (vocs) such as benzene, chloroform, etc.; inspirable particles; and metals (e.g., lead, arsenic, etc.) than the general population in region v. means and medians were the metrics of comparison. personal air exposures for p-dichlorobenzene were significantly higher in adults (> 21 years old) than in children (1-14 years old) (median: below detection limit vs. 0.87 mu g/m(3), p = 0.0005), while a trend toward higher levels of arsenic exposure in children than adults was observed (median: 1.13 vs. 0.8 ng/m(3), p = 0.083). a trend towards higher personal air exposure to lead for minorities vs. nonminorities was evident (median: 26 vs. 12 ng/m(3), p = 0.066), but personal exposure to 1,1,1-trichloroethane tended to be higher in nonminorities (mean: 22 vs. 3.7 mu g/m(3), p = 0.081). dietary exposure to arsenic from solid foods was significantly higher in adults than children (mean: 21 vs. 7.1 mu g/kg, p = 0.0001; median: 10 vs. 5.6 mu g/kg, p = < 0.001), and for cadmium it was higher for nonminorities than minorities (median: 18 vs. 15 mu g/kg, p = 0.023). ln contrast, the dietary intake for arsenic, which is based on body weight, was significantly higher in children than adults (mean: 1.72 vs 1.38 mu g kg(-1) day(-1), p = < 0.0001; median 1.02 vs. 0.83, p = < 0.0001). dietary exposure to chromium in beverages tended to be higher in minorities than nonminorities (median: 16 vs. 13 mu g/kg, p = 0.017). lead levels in surface dust wipes tended to increase with the age of the home (mean: 128 mu g/g in homes built since 1980 to 1075 mu g/g in homes built before 1940; median: 93 to 236 mu g/g, respectively). these findings were consistent with the observation that for persons living in older homes personal air exposures to lead are elevated compared to persons living in recently built homes (median: 12 ng/m3 in homes built since 1980, vs. 24 ng/m(3) in homes built before 1940, p = 0.043).",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Great Lakes region mentioned,,,
"lead, mercury, and organochlorine compound levels in cord blood in québec, canada","we conducted this study to evaluate blood levels of lead, mercury, and organochlorine compounds in newborns in the province of quebec. during 1993 to 1995, we carried out a survey in 10 hospitals located in southern quebec. during that time, umbilical cord blood samples were obtained from 1109 newborns, and we analyzed each for lead, mercury, 14 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, and 11 chlorinated pesticides. we used the geometric mean and 95% confidence interval (ci) to describe the results. mean concentrations of lead and mercury in cord blood were 0.076 micromol/l (95% ci = 0.074, 0.079) and 4.82 nmol/l (95% ci = 4.56, 5.08), respectively. the mean concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (aroclor 1260) and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene were 0.514 microg/i (95% ci = .493, 0.536) and 0.412 microg/l (95% ci = 0.390, 0.435), respectively. we observed a statistically significant relationship between maternal age and cord blood concentrations of (a) lead, (b) mercury, (c) polychlorinated biphenyls, and (d) dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene. in addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with cord blood lead levels. the cord blood concentrations of lead, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene we measured in our study were the lowest levels recently reported in industrialized countries. the results of this study underline the role of public health authorities in the evaluation of biological levels of environmental contaminants among children for the assessment of risk of adverse health effects.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
population-based data and the development of individual children: the case of low to moderate lead levels and intelligence,"this essay is an exploration of the problem of applying research results based on large numbers to the individual child and the child's development. the main argument of the article is that the results of population-based studies are not directly relevant to individuals and that attempts to apply findings to individual children are often based on misunderstandings about measurement, statistics, and the processes of development. although research into the relationship of elevated lead levels and cognitive development serves as a specific context for exploring these general issues, the issues are germane to many areas of development and many potential influences. the goal of the article is to provide an explicit discussion of scientific issues presented to members of the public and potential sources of confusion.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
maternal perceptions of lead poisoning in children with normal and elevated lead levels,"introduction: the purpose of this study was to examine mothers' perceptions of the severity and susceptibility of their children to lead poisoning and to determine if a correlation existed between mothers' knowledge of lead poisoning and their children's blood lead levels. it was thought that mothers of children with lead poisoning (lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl) would score lower on a test of their perceptions and knowledge of lead poisoning than would mothers of children with normal lead levels (lead levels < or = 9 micrograms/dl). method: a cross-sectional study comparing scores of a questionnaire completed by mothers whose children had elevated blood lead levels and mothers whose children had normal blood lead levels was conducted. results: no difference was found in the median test score between the 2 groups. for the correct responses on a question-by-question comparison, significant difference existed between groups; however, the percentage of correct responses was not always greater for the mothers of children with normal blood lead levels. discussion: mothers' perceptions and knowledge of lead poisoning were not associated with their children's blood lead levels.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

the effect of dust lead control on blood lead in toddlers: a randomized trial,"background. contaminated household dust is believed to be a major source of exposure for most children with elevated blood lead levels. to determine if a vigorous dust clean-up effort would reduce this exposure we conducted a randomized controlled field trial. methods. we randomized 113 urban children between the ages of 6 and 36 months: 56 children to a lead dust intervention composed of maternal education and biweekly assistance with household cleaning and 57 children to a control group. household cleaning was done by two trained lay workers who focused their efforts on wet mopping of floors, damp-sponging of walls and horizontal surfaces, and vacuuming with a high-efficiency particle accumulating vacuum. household dust lead levels, child blood lead levels, and maternal knowledge of lead poisoning and sources of exposure were measured before and after the intervention. results. ninety-nine children were successfully followed for 12 +/- 3 months: 46 children in the lead group and 53 children in the control group. age and blood lead were similar in the two groups at baseline and averaged 20 months and 12.0 mu g/dl, respectively. blood lead fell 17% in the intervention group and did not change among controls. household dust and dust lead measures also fell significantly in the intervention group. children in homes cleaned 20 or more times throughout the year had an average blood lead reduction of 34%. conclusions. regular home cleaning, accompanied by maternal education, is a safe and partially effective intervention that should be recommended for the large majority of lead-exposed children for whom, unfortunately, removal to lead-safe housing is not an option.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,NA
comparison of the entropy technique with two other techniques for detecting disease clustering using data from children with high blood lead levels,"the entropy technique was compared with two other case-control techniques for detecting disease clustering using data on blood lead levels of children who were patients at the king/drew medical center in south-central los angeles in 1991 to 1994. the other two methods are the nearest neighbor technique (nnt) and moran's ipop technique, a variation of moran's i test, in which rates are adjusted for population size. four different blood lead levels (15 microg/dl, 20 microg/dl, 30 microg/dl, 35 microg/dl) were used as cutoff levels to designate cases. persons with blood lead levels greater than or equal to the cutoff level were designated as cases. the authors found significant clustering for all four cutoff levels using the entropy method, and for the first three cutoff levels using the nnt. they found significant clustering with moran's ipop for some scales for two of the cutoff levels. while performance of the entropy technique and the nnt were independent of scale, that of moran's ipop was highly scale-dependent.",nongeographical,california,0,Los Angelas mentioned,biology,methods,NA

the use of composite dust wipe samples as a means of assessing lead exposure,"this study investigated two methods for analyzing composite dust wipes for lead. the term composite means two or more wipes collected from common components in a dwelling that are combined in the field and analyzed as a single sample, two methods-a modified environmental protection agency (epa) method 3050a and a wisconsin occupational health laboratory (wohl) method-were selected based on their anticipated ability to handle the added mass of materials and dust expected in a composite, the study used off-the-shelf wipes to prepare single-, two-, and four-wipe samples. wipes were spiked with a standard reference material at either a low dust loading level or a high level, and three laboratories analyzed the samples using both methods and both flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry techniques (icp). good agreement with known spiked levels was possible using either method; the modified epa 3050a showed particular promise. when up to four wipes were combined, all three laboratories found that modified epa method 3050a resulted in recoveries between 89 and 101% of the known standard. although it was possible to achieve good agreement with spiked levels using the wohl method, some difficulties were encountered, particularly when followed by icp analysis and when using four wipes, the increased time required to digest the multiwipe composites was not proportional to the number of wipes in a composite: the two- and four-wipe composites did not take two to four times as long as a single-wipe sample. laboratory analysis of a four-wipe sample cost an average of 65% less than analysis of four single-wipe samples for each method.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,"Wisconsin Occupational Health Laboratory mentioned as a method, but not location of research",,,

maternal blood lead level during pregnancy in south central los angeles,"twenty-five years of public health efforts produced a striking reduction in lead exposure; the blood lead average in the united states has decreased to less than 20% of levels measured in the 1970s. however, poor minority groups that live in large urban centers are still at high risk for elevated lead levels. in this study, our data showed that pregnant immigrants (n = 1 428) who live in south central los angeles-one of the most economically depressed regions of california-have significantly higher (p <.0001) blood lead levels (geometric mean = 2.3 mu g/dl [0.11 mu mol/l]) than 504 pregnant nonimmigrants (geometric mean = 1.9 mu g/dl [0.09 mu mol/l]). the most important factors associated with lower blood lead levels in both groups were younger age; more-recent date of blood sampling (i.e., decreasing secular trend); and blood sampling in mid-autumn, instead of mid-spring (i.e., seasonal trend). blood lead levels of immigrants were strongly dependent on time elapsed since immigration to the united states; each natural log increase in years of residence was associated with an approximately 19% decrease in blood lead levels. although blood lead means for both groups were almost the same as the estimated national average, 25 of the 30 cases of elevated blood lead (i.e., greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dl [0.48 mu mol/l]) occurred in the immigrant group. the odds ratio (95% confidence intervals within parentheses) for having elevated blood lead levels (a) was 9.3 (1.9, 45.8) if the immigrant engaged in pica; (b) was 3.8 (1.4, 10.5) if the immigrant had low dietary calcium intake during pregnancy; and (c) was .65 (.43, .98) for every natural log unit increase of years of residence in the united states. the control of pica and dietary calcium intake may offer a means of reducing lead exposure in immigrants.",nongeographical,california,0,Los Angelas,maternity,prenatal,NA

evaluation of four sampling methods for determining exposure of children to lead-contaminated household dust,"childhood exposure to lead has been demonstrated to result in health effects and lead-contaminated household dust is a primary exposure source. there is a need to establish reliable methods for sampling surfaces to determine levels of lead contamination. three vacuums (hvs3, gs80, and mvm) and one wipe method were evaluated for the collection of household floor dust under field sampling conditions within a superfund site and demographically similar control area. side-by-side floor samples were taken from three locations within 41 randomly selected households between august and september 1995: a child's bedroom, primary play area, and primary entrance. analysis was performed to assess the relative collection performance of each sampler, spatial distribution of lead within a household, and correlation of lead loading with observed blood lead level, and to determine if discrete or composites samples were more predictive of blood lead levels. approximately 90% of the floor surfaces were carpeted. the rank order of sampling methods from greatest to lowest collection efficiency was hvs3 > gs80 > wipe > mvm. the hvs3 had the highest level of precision (cv=0.05), with the gs80 and wipe precisions 0.48 and 0.053, respectively. lead loadings for samples collected in bedrooms and living areas and composite samples using the hvs3 and wipe methods were significantly correlated with blood lead levels. correlations between blood lead levels and composite samples were stronger for the hvs3 (r(2)=0.33, p=0.003) and wipe (r(2)=0.25, p=0.002) methods than the respective discrete samples. regression analysis indicated that a blood lead level of 10 microgram/dl corresponds to a carpet wipe sample geometric mean of 68 microgram/ft(2). for ongoing public health purposes, such as screening and clearance testing, use of the wipe sampling method is the most appropriate. this investigation supports findings by others that the present hud risk levels for lead in floor wipe samples may not be adequate for reducing children's blood lead levels below 10 microgram/dl.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

blood lead levels among children of lead-exposed workers: a meta-analysis,"background to further assess the utility of targeted blood lead screening for children from households with members having occupational lead exposures, we conducted a meta-analysis of all available reports of take-home lead exposures. our objective was to estimate the blood lead levels among u.s children (ages 1-5) from households with lead-exposed workers. methods reports considered for inclusion were cited in medline, toxline, excerpta medica, and bio-med plus all unpublished reports available at the national institute for occupational safety and health through 1994. the a priori criteria for inclusion of u.s. reports required their having data on: (1) venous blood lead level for children, (2) children's ages, (3) data for at least five children, (4) workers' occupations (5) workers' blood lead levels, and (6) data collection methods. results based on a meta-analysis of 10 reports from 1987 through 1994, the children (n = 139) of lead-exposed workers (n = 222) had a geometric mean blood lead level of 9.3 mu g/dl compared to a u.s. population geometric mean of 3.6 mu g/dl (p = 0.0006). also in this group, 52% of the children had blood lead levels (blls) greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dl compared to 8.9% in the u.s. (p = .0010), and 21% of the children had blls greater than or equal to 20 mu g/dl compared to 1.1% in the u.s. (p = .0258). conclusions: we estimate, based on 1981-83 survey data, that there are about 48,000 families with children under six living with household members occupationally exposed to lead. if the findings from this meta-analysis (admittedly limited by small numbers) are generalizable, about half of the young children in these families may have blls greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dl. data were too sparse to determine if children of workers with elevated blood leads were at greater risk than children whose parents were only known to be lead exposed. our findings support the position that children of lead-exposed workers should be targeted for blood lead screening. am. j. ind. med. 36:475-481, 1999. published 1999 wiley-liss, inc.dagger.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

influence of bone-lead stores on the observed effectiveness of lead hazard intervention,"lead hazard interventions have reduced children's blood-lead concentrations, but do not eliminate lead altogether from the bloodstream. several studies suggest that blood-lead concentrations, measured 6 to 12 months after such interventions, decline by approximately 25%. the environmental protection agency is preparing to promulgate a rule prescribing residential lead levels in paint, dust, and soil that constitute a lead-based paint hazard. such a rule will prompt interventions of primary prevention character (i.e., precluding exposure before it occurs) rather than the secondary prevention character interventions (i.e., alleviating exposure after it has adversely affected the resident child) documented in the literature. it is important to attempt to estimate the efficacy achieved from the primary prevention interventions prompted by the rule's promulgation. as bone-lead stores represent the principal confounding factor to relating secondary prevention results to primary prevention, this paper addresses the impact of lead stored in bone, which may later be released to the blood and other parts of the child's body. a simple, but thoroughly documented, modeling exercise is presented to estimate the maximum length of time for which bone-lead stores alone could account for continuing elevated blood-lead levels observed in children following an intervention. the approach is based on a two-compartment model for the transfer of lead between blood and bone tissues within the body and the elimination of lead from the body. modeling results suggest that bone-lead mobilization can impact blood-lead levels of young children for considerably long periods following an intervention. these results may explain the seemingly contradictory fact that low declines in blood-lead concentrations are observed despite the significant reduction in residential dust-, paint-, and soil-lead levels observed following lead hazard interventions. an intervention which reduces a 5-year-old child's total lead exposure by 50% might, due to mobilized bone-lead stores, produce only a 25% decline in the child's blood-lead concentrations measured 12 months following the intervention. the results also suggest, however, that those intervention strategies for which less than 25% declines were observed 12 months following the intervention likely eliminated less than 50% of the children's total lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
hair and blood as substrates for screening children for lead poisoning,"in russia, hair, rather than blood, is usually used as a substrate for screening children for lead poisoning. we attempted to gauge the accuracy of this method by comparing these two methods. the evaluation was done in saratov, russia. we collected hair and blood samples from 189 children who attended 11 kindergartens. their mean blood lead concentration was 9.8 mu g/dl (range = 3.1-35.7 mu g/dl), and their mean hair lead concentration was 7.2 mu g/g (range = 1.0-7.2 mu g/g [i.e., 1.0 being the lowest detectable limit]). hair lead concentration as a screening method had 57% sensitivity and resulted in 18% of the children being classified as false-negatives. we conclude, therefore, that measuring hair lead concentration is not an adequate method with which to screen children for lead poisoning.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
blood lead level and blood pressure during pregnancy in south central los angeles,"in many studies in which the relationship between blood pressure and blood lead level has been examined, investigators have found significant-hut small-associations. there was only one previous report of a significant association of blood lead with blood pressure in pregnant women. we measured blood lead level and sitting blood pressure of 1 627 women in their third trimester of pregnancy. we eliminated subjects with known causes of hypertension. most women (98.4%) were normotensive. we controlled for body mass index, age, and stress-among other factors-and constructed multiple-regression models of lead association with diastolic and systolic blood pressures. immigrants (73% of total) bad significantly higher blood lead levels and different blood pressures than nonimmigrants, suggesting that analysis be stratified by """"immigrant, nonimmigrant"""" status. positive relationships between blood lead level and blood pressure were found only for immigrants (p less than or equal to .001). from the 5th to 95th blood-lead percentiles (0.9-6.2 mu g/dl) in immigrants, systolic blood pressure increased 2.8 mm hg, and diastolic blood pressure increased 2.4 mm hg, higher prior lead exposure of immigrants (97.7% from latin countries) than nonimmigrants might explain the differential effect of these low levels of blood lead on blood pressure in nonimmigrants. perhaps some immigrants are at higher risk than nonimmigrants far lead-associated elevated blood pressure during pregnancy, despite blood lead levels within the currently considered acceptable range.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
low-cost household paint abatement to reduce children's blood lead levels,"the purpose was to examine the effectiveness of low-cost abatement on children's blood lead levels. blood lead was analyzed before and after abatement in 37 homes of children under 7 years old with initial blood lead levels of 25-44 microgram/dl. ninety-five percent of homes were built before 1950. abatement methods used were wet-scraping and repainting deteriorated surfaces and wrapping window wells with aluminum or vinyl. a control group was retrospectively selected. control children were under 7 years old, had initial blood lead levels of 25-44 microgram/dl and a follow-up level at least 28 days afterward, and did not have abatements performed in their homes between blood lead levels. after abatement, statistically significant declines occurred in the intervention children's blood lead levels. the mean decline was 22%, 1 to 6 months after treatment. after adjustment for seasonality and child's age, the mean decline was 6.0 microgram/dl, or 18%. the control children's blood levels did not decline significantly. there was a mean decline of 0.25 microgram/dl, or 0.39%. after adjustment for seasonality and age, the mean decline for control children was 1.6 microgram/dl, or 1.8%. low-cost abatement and education are effective short-term interim controls.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
effects of reducing lead in gasoline: an analysis of the international experience,"to assess the relations between use of lead in gasoline (gpb) and population blood lead levels (bpb), we examined 19 studies from six continents. in 17 of the studies, there are data on changes in bpb before and after changes in use of lead in gasoline. in 11 of the studies, there are data on air lead levels (apb). for a given location, there is a strong linear correlation between bpb and gpb, with a median correlation coefficient of 0.94. across locations for a given gpb, bpb is positively correlated with city population. as gpb is reduced to zero, blood lead levels across locations converge to a median of 3 mu g/dl. this convergence of bpb levels occurs at different times for different locations and corresponds to the timing of gasoline lead reductions. for those locations with available air lead data, air lead concentrations converge to less than or equal to 0.2 mu g/m(3) as gpb is reduced to zero. together, these features indicate that reductions in gasoline lead levels have been a major causal factor in the observed reductions in population blood lead levels at these locations and show that bpb levels of about 3 mu g/dl are widely achievable.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
acquisition and retention of lead by young children,"the concentrations and isotope ratios of lead in blood and urine, on the hands, and in duplicate diet samples were measured for children living in omaha, nebraska. one group consisted of 22 children followed from birth to between 1 and 2 years of age and another group was 20 2- to 4-year-old children followed for 1 year, although some in each group were followed for periods between 3 and 4 years. at no time in life was a component of dietary lead identified in blood by isotope ratios, and blood lead appears dominated by lead derived from the hands, which in turn appears derived from the floors. for some homes floor lead appeared to be a mixture of lead from window sills and from the exterior. only 2 of the children appear to have ingested lead directly from window sills. several who lived in homes being remodeled were exposed to lead before the age of 2 years. for those who had been briefly exposed during professional remodeling the blood lead fell with a half-life of 10 months but for those who had suffered prolonged exposure during remodeling by parents the apparent half-life was longer, between 20 and 38 months.",nebraska,nebraska,1,,biology,residential,indoor
emissions of lead and zinc from candles with metal-core wicks,"we measured the amount of lead released from 14 different brands of candles with metal-core wicks sold in michigan. the emissions of lead were found to range from 0.5 to 66 mu g/h, and the rates for zinc were from 1.2 to 124 mu g/h. it is estimated that burning four of the candles bought in michigan for 2 h can result in airborne lead concentrations that can pose a threat to human health. in addition to inhalation of lead in the air, children get exposed to lead in candle fumes deposited on the floor, furniture and walls through their hand-to-mouth activity. burning candles with leaded-core wick may be an important exposure route for lead that has generally been ignored.

assessment of a lead management program for inner-city children,"lead poisoning is a significant health problem among some children living in inner-city homes in toledo, ohio, and elsewhere. the department of housing and urban development (hud) provided a three-year grant to the city of toledo for an environmental lead remediation program. this study retrospectively reviewed records of houses contaminated with lead and blood-lead levels (blls) in children for the period january 1995 to august 1998. the authors then evaluated the sources of lead exposure and the influence of chelation therapy and parent lead education on children's blls. the children who participated in this study lived in the inner city and were from low-income families. they occupied pre-1950 houses with lead based paint concentrations that in some areas were greater than 9.9 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm(2)), well exceeding the hud guideline of 1.0 mg/cm(2). levels of lead dust in soil and on surfaces in homes also were greater than the respective hud guidelines of 400 micrograms per gram (mug/g) and 100 to 800 microgram per square foot (mug.ft(2)). about 88 percent of the 165 children evaluated had elevated blls-that is, blls greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dl). among children who received chelation therapy, the postchelation mean bll was statistically lower (p < .001) than the prechelation mean bll, but it remained elevated. among nonchelated children, the mean bll at the final screening was statistically,higher (p < .001) than the mean bll at initial screenings, these results suggest that chelation alone was not sufficient to lower the concentration of lead in children's blood to an acceptable level (less than 10 mug/dl) and that the single visit a health care worker made to each home to educate the parents about lead was inadequate. both chelated and nonchelated children continued to occupy lead-contaminated homes through the duration of the study. accordingly the authors draw three conclusions: chelation therapy and parent education about lead do not always adequately lower children's blls if exposure continues. parents should receive more frequent and more comprehensive education about lead. residence in lead-free homes remains the most effective option to control children's blls.",ohio,ohio,1,,screening,residential,both
methods of exposure assessment: lead-contaminated dust in philadelphia schools,"this study was conducted to develop a method that would accurately assess children's exposure to lead in schools in philadelphia, pennsylvania. we examined three wipe sample protocols: one included accessible surfaces such as desktops and windowsills, the second included inaccessible surfaces such as the top of filing cabinets and light fixtures, and the third included hand wipes of the study participants. surface wipes were collected at 10 locations from accessible and inaccessible classroom surfaces (n = 11 at each location) and from the palms of student subjects in the same locations (n = 168). we found a significant difference in lead dust concentrations determined by the three protocols (f = 4.619; 2,27 degrees of freedom; p = 0.019). lead dust concentrations were significantly elevated at the inaccessible surfaces yet they were uniformly low on the accessible surfaces and the children's palms. these findings were consistent with observed changes in blood lead levels of study participants: after 6 months of exposure to the study locations, 156 of 168 children experienced no change in blood lead level, whereas 12 experienced only a minimal change of 1-2 mu g/dl. the mere presence of lead in inaccessible dust in the school environment does not automatically constitute a health hazard because there may not be a completed exposure pathway.",pennsylvania,pennsylvania,1,,screening,school,indoor
long-term effect of dust control on blood lead concentrations,"background: dust control is recommended to prevent children's exposure to residential lead hazards, but the long-term effect of dust control on children's exposure to environmental lead is unknown. objective: to determine the effect of dust control on children's exposure to lead, as measured by blood lead concentration at 48 months of age. design: a randomized, controlled trial. setting. rochester, new york. participants: a total of 275 urban children were randomized at 6 months of age; 189 (69%) were available for the 48-month follow-up blood test. intervention. children and their families were randomly assigned to an intervention group that received cleaning equipment and up to 8 visits by a trained lead hazard control advisor or to a control group. the intervention was terminated when the children were 24 months of age. outcome measures: geometric mean blood lead concentration and prevalence of elevated blood lead concentration (ie, >/=10 microg/dl, >/=15 microg/dl, and >/=20 microg/dl), by group assignment. results: for children with 48-month blood tests, baseline geometric mean blood lead concentrations were 2.8 microg/dl (95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.6, 3.0); there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or lead exposure by group assignment. at 48 months of age, the geometric mean blood lead was 5.9 microg/dl (95% ci: 5.3, 6.7) for the intervention group and 6.1 microg/dl (95% ci: 5.5,6.9) for the control group. the percentage of children with a 48-month blood lead >/=10 microg/dl, >/=15 microg/dl, and >/=20 microg/dl was 19% versus 19%, 2% versus 9%, and 1% versus 2% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. conclusions: we conclude that dust control, as performed by families and in the absence of lead hazard controls to reduce ongoing contamination from lead-based paint, was not effective in preventing children's exposure to residential lead hazards.",new york,new york,1,,dust,residential,indoor
the relationship between residential lead exposures and elevated blood lead levels in a rural mining community,"a 80-year history of lead mining iu rural northeastern oklahoma has resulted in widespread coverage of residential areas with mine waste from mined blown dispersion of mined materials and deliberate use of tailings in construction and road maintenance. for this study, environmental samples (soil, dust, paint, water) were collected with standardized techniques from a population based random sample of 245 residences as part of a blood lead screening project. nearly so percent of study homes contained lead-based paint, lead in floor dust exceeded the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud) standard in approximately 10 percent of the homes, and in over 20 percent, yard soils had lead levels above the u.s. environmental protection agency (u.s. epa) standard, multivariate analysis of environmental and blood lead data found that four variables were independently associated with elevated blood lead levels: floor dust (odds ratio [or] = 8.1, and confidence interval [ci] = 1.8, 37.8); yard soil (or = 6.4, and ci = 1.4, 30.7); interior paint (or = 3.0, and ci = 1.2, 7.8); and location of residence (or = 3.4, and ci = 1.3, 8.8), these data demonstrate that effective residential remediation strategies must address paint, dust, and yard soils, the environmental assessment also found that nearly 20 percent of homes outside the mining area had contaminated soil, indicating that soil remediation efforts will have to extend beyond the current boundaries of the superfund site.",oklahoma,oklahoma,1,,environment,environment,both
survey of selected activities relevant to exposures to soils,"in the summer and fall of 1996, a survey of randomly selected u.s. households was conducted by computer assisted telephone interview (catt). the primary purpose of the survey, dubbed soil contact survey (scs-i), was quantification of behavioral patterns pertinent to dermal exposure to soil. results of the survey and a follow-up (scs-ii) conducted in 1998 have been applied to estimation of a metric of dermal soil exposure termed the soil contact rate (scr). partial results have been presented elsewhere (garlock et al., 1999; wong et al., in press). the purpose of this paper is dissemination of selected data gathered in scs-i that have not been formally incorporated in scr estimation, but are of potential interest to exposure assessors. in scs-i, respondents were questioned regarding multiple activities potentially relevant to evaluation of residential exposure to soil. data presented here describe frequency of consumption of homegrown produce, frequency of shoe removal prior to residence entry, type of floor covering, indoor/outdoor pet ownership, occurrence of bare yard soil and residential proximity to vacant lots or fields. ingestion of foods grown in home gardens is of concern because local soil contamination may lead to elevated exposures (usepa, 1997a). chemical contaminants in soil may be transferred to plant tissues by absorption or adsorption (mckone, 1994). produce may also be a vehicle for ingestion of soil not washed from edible plant surfaces. a survey performed by the national gardening association reported that 34 million u.s. households (38 percent of the total) participated in vegetable gardening in 1986 (usepa, 1997a). tomatoes, peppers, onions, cucumbers, lettuce, beans, carrots, and corn are the most commonly grown vegetables. epa analysis of usda nationwide food consumption survey (nfcs) data from 1987-88 produced estimates that 18% of u.s. citizens greater than or equal to 1 year of age consume homegrown vegetables and 8% consume homegrown fruit (usepa,1997a). residential exposures to contaminants in outdoor soils may occur indoors if house dust is impacted by track-in of soil. house dust is considered to be a mixture of biologically-derived material, deposited aerosols and soil particles brought in by foot traffic (thatcher and layton, 1995; usepa, 1997b). the fraction attributable to outdoor soil has been estimated to be 30 to 40 percent (fergusson and kim, 1991). outdoor soil and indoor dust lead levels have been found to be positively associated (rabinowitz and bellinger, 1988; thornton et al, 1990; berny et al., 1994). thatcher and layton (1995) studied """"""""tracked"""""""" and """"""""untracked"""""""" areas of floor surfaces and found that areas subject to foot traffic showed higher accumulation (mass/area) of dust. nishioka et al. (1996) demonstrated transfer of herbicide from treated turf to carpet in a track-in simulation. due to size selection, lack of degradation indoors other factors, contaminants may become enriched in house dusts. for instance, pesticide levels in indoor dust were found to be much higher than in outdoor soils in an agricultural community in washington state (simcox et al., 1995). shoe removal has been hypothesized to reduce soil track-in (ott and roberts, 1998; roberts et at., 1999). pets may assist children with access to soil by digging or by accumulating soil and dust in their fur. pets with access to both the indoors and outdoors can also bring outdoor soil and dust into the home. thomas et al. (1976) linked increased blood lead levels in dogs with increased blood lead levels in children aged 1 to 6 in the same households. berny et al. (1995) found a similar result for dogs and/or cars. the strongest association occurred in the youngest age group (children less than or equal to 6) with """"""""mostly inside"""""""" pets. type of floor covering may also be important in assessing exposure to house dust and related contaminants. carpets appear to act as storage reservoirs for some persistent contaminants (lewis et al., 1994; whitmore et al., 1994; roberts et al., 1999). carpeted areas also typically have higher dust mass per unit area than uncarpeted areas (thatcher and layton, 1995). patches of bare soil in yards provide easy access to soil. hwang et al. (1997) reported an association between urinary arsenic in children and soil arsenic in bare spots in yards. residential proximity to vacant lots or fields is of interest because vacant land represents a possible opportunity for exposure to bare soils for children who are otherwise locally restricted to well maintained yards or to paved surfaces. vacant lots may also have a history of use as dumping grounds due to lack of oversight.",NA,nongeographical,0,,,,

targeting lead screening: the ohio lead risk score,"objective: annual blood lead (bpb) screening is recommended for children </=2 years of age residing in high-risk areas. strategies for identifying these areas exist but lack specificity. we sought to develop an efficient method for identifying risk factors for undue lead exposure in children by using community variables. design: logistic regression for model development in one half of the sample followed by validation of the model in the remaining half. methods: the association between selected census tract characteristics from 19 ohio counties and the bpb test results of children living in those census tracts was evaluated. the dependent variable, high-risk status, was defined as a census tract with >/=12% of bpb test results >/=10 microg/dl. results: data from 897 census tracts were available. higher risk for lead toxicity existed in areas where: 1) >/=55% of houses were built before 1950 (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 10.9 [6.1,19.6]); 2) >/=35% of residents were black (aor: 3.5 [2.0,6. 3]); 3) >/=35% of residents had less than a high school education (aor: 6.1 [3.6,10.4]); and 4) >/=50% of housing units were renter-occupied (aor: 3.6 [2.1,6.2]). receiver operator characteristic (roc) curves demonstrated no significant differences after applying the model in a second dataset. conclusions: several community characteristics predict risk for lead toxicity in children and may provide a useful approach to focus lead screening, especially in communities where public health resources are limited. the approach described here may also prove helpful in identifying factors within a community associated with other environmental public health hazards for children.",ohio,ohio,1,,screening,sociodemographic,NA
lead-contaminated imported tamarind candy and children's blood lead levels,"in 1999, an investigation implicated tamarind candy as the potential source of lead exposure for a child with a significantly elevated blood lead level (bll). the oklahoma city-county health department tested two types of tamarind suckers and their packaging for lead content. more than 50% of the tested suckers exceeded the us food and drug administration (fda) level of concern for lead in this type of product. the authors calculated that a child consuming one-quarter to one-half of either of the two types of suckers in a day would exceed the maximum fda provis onal tolerable intake for lead. high lead concentrations in the two types of wrappers suggested leaching as a potential source of contamination. the authors used the environmental protection agency's integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model to predict the effects of consumption of contaminated tamarind suckers on populat on blls. the ieubk model predicted that consumption of either type of sucker at a rate of one per day would result in dramatic increases in mean blls for children ages 6-84 months in oklahoma and in the percentage of children wth elevated blls (> or =10 micrograms per deciliter [microg/dl]). the authors conclude that consumption of these products represents a potential public health threat. in addition, a history of lead contamination in imported tamarind products suggests that import control measures may not be completely effective in preventing additional lead exposure.",oklahoma,oklahoma,1,,nutrition,product,NA
association of silicofluoride treated water with elevated blood lead,"previous epidemiological studies have associated silicofluoride-treated community water with enhanced child blood lead parameters. chronic, low-level dosage of silicofluoride (sif) has never been adequately tested for health effects in humans. we report here on a statistical study of 151,225 venous blood lead (vbl) tests taken from children ages 0-6 inclusive, living in 105 communities of populations from 15,000 to 75,000. the tests are part of a sample collected by the new york state department of children's health, mostly from 1994-1998. community fluoridation status was determined from the cdc 1992 fluoridation census. covariates were assigned to each community using the 1990 u.s. census. blood lead measures were divided into groups based on race and age. logistic regressions were carried out for each race/age group, as well as above and below the median of 7 covariates to test the relationship between known risk factors for lead uptake, exposure to sif-treated water, and vbl >10 microg/dl. results: for every age/race group, there was a consistently significant association of sif treated community water and elevated blood lead. logistic regressions above and below the median value of seven covariates show an effect of silicofluoride on blood lead independent of those covariates. the highest likelihood of children having vbl> 10 microg/dl occurs when they are both exposed to sif treated water and likely to be subject to another risk factor known to be associated with high blood lead (e.g., old housing). results are consistent with prior analyses of surveys of children's blood lead in massachusetts and nhanes iii. these data contradict the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the toxic effects of sif and sodium fluoride, pointing to the need for chemical studies and comprehensive animal testing of water treated with commercial grade silicofluorides.",NA,new york,0,,nutrition,water treatment,NA
cognitive deficits associated with blood lead concentrations <10 microg/dl in us children and adolescents,"objectivelead is a confirmed neurotoxicant, but the lowest blood lead concentration associated with deficits in cognitive functioning and academic achievement is poorly defined. the purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship of relatively low blood lead concentrations-especially concentrations <10 micrograms per deciliter (microg/dl)--with performance on tests of cognitive functioning in a representative sample of us children and adolescents.methodsthe authors used data from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes iii), conducted from 1988 to 1994, to assess the relationship between blood lead concentration and performance on tests of arithmetic skills, reading skills, nonverbal reasoning, and short-term memory among 4,853 children ages 6-16 years.resultsthe geometric mean blood lead concentration for children n the study sample was 1.9 microg/dl; 172 (2.1%) had blood lead concentrations > or =10 microg/dl. after adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, poverty, region of the country, parent or caregiver's educational level, parent or caregiver's marital status parent, serum ferritin level, and serum cotinine level, the data showed an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and scores on four measures of cognitive functioning. for every 1 microg/dl increase in blood lead concentration, there was a 0.7-point decrement in mean arithmetic scores, an approximately 1-point decrement in mean reading scores, a 0.1-point decrement in mean scores on a measure of nonverbal reasoning, and a 0.5-point decrement in mean scores on a measure of short-term memory. an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and arithmetic and reading scores was observed for children with blood lead concentrations lower than 5.0 microg/dl.conclusiondeficits in cognitive and academic skills associated with lead exposure occur at blood lead concentrations lower than 5 microg/dl.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
residence location as a measure of environmental exposure: a review of air pollution epidemiology studies,"residence location has long been used to indicate environmental exposure in many epidemiological studies. this indicator is easy to establish, requires little exposure or monitoring data, and is potentially applicable to many types of investigations. the validity, accuracy and utility of residence location as an exposure indicator, however, is challenged by current concerns regarding multiple exposure pathways, persistent and toxic contaminants, and cumulative exposures from non-point, mobile and point sources. this paper reviews 45 epidemiological studies that use residence location to identify study populations and estimate air pollution exposures. thirteen (29%) of the studies determined environmental exposures based on """"proximity"""" measures, usually the distance from a subject's residence to a pollutant source. other studies used """"zones"""" presumed to have equal pollutant levels. several studies combined zone and proximity approaches. exposures were quantified using monitoring data in 27 (60%) studies and dispersion modeling in two (4%) studies. sixteen (36%) studies did not use any environmental data to quantify exposure. a total of 31 (69%) of the studies reported significant associations between health endpoints and the pollutant exposures represented by residence location. in general, comprehensive and systematic approaches to identify and estimate population exposures were not used, and the exposure estimates were therefore deemed likely to have great uncertainty. unless exposure levels among groups are verified, it cannot be determined whether nonsignificant associations between exposures and health endpoints indicate a lack of measurable health effects, or are merely a result of exposure misclassification. site-specific and quantitative exposure assessments are needed to better quantify and confirm exposures within such studies, as well as to permit interpretations and comparisons across studies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
determination of spatial continuity of soil lead levels in an urban residential neighborhood,"this study uses geostatistical techniques to model and estimate soil lead levels in an urban, residential neighborhood. sixty-two composite soil samples (median 1773 ppm; range 175 to 7953 ppm) in a four-block area of brick and stone homes were obtained. the spatial continuity of soil lead levels was modeled with a semi-variogram, which was then used to estimate lead levels at unsampled locations, a process called kriging. because soil lead levels were spatially correlated, it is likely that a """"nonrandom"""" process generated the lead distribution found. this finding signifies the existence of lead sources which were tentatively identified on historical maps of the area and from past traffic volume patterns. the distribution of kriged estimates of soil lead levels provides an explanatory tool for exploring and identifying potential sources and mag be useful for targeting urban soil abatement efforts.

"elevated blood lead levels among internationally adopted children--united states, 1998","lead poisoning has been reported recently among chinese children adopted by u.s. citizens. however, little is known about the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (blls) among adoptees from china and other countries. persistent sources of lead exposure outside the united states include leaded gasoline exhaust; industrial emissions; cottage industries (e.g., battery breaking and recycling plants); traditional medicines; and some cosmetics, ceramic ware, and foods. in 1998, approximately 15,000 orphans from countries outside the united states who were adopted abroad or were to be adopted in the united states by u.s. citizens were issued u.s. immigrant visas-a nearly two-fold increase over 1988 (l. lewis, immigrant and visa control and reporting division, visa office, bureau of consular affairs, u.s. state department, personal communication, august 1999). some orphans have been abandoned for extended periods and have no obtainable medical history. immigrants aged <15 years are not required to have serologic or blood tests either in their country of origin or on entry into the united states unless exposure to syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus is suspected. to obtain reports on the prevalence of elevated blls (> or =10 microg/dl) among international adoptees, cdc contacted 12 international adoption medical specialists identified through the joint council on international children's services and two collaborating medical specialists. this report summarizes the results of that investigation, which suggest that international adoptees may arrive in the united states with elevated blls.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
seasonal influences on childhood lead exposure,"we conducted a study to examine seasonal changes in residential dust lead content and its relationship to blood lead in preschool children. we collected blood and dust samples (floors, windowsills, and carpets) to assess lead exposure. the geometric mean blood lead concentrations are 10.77 and 7.66 microg/dl for the defined hot and cold periods, respectively (p < 0.05). lead loading (milligrams per square meter) is the measure derived from floor and windowsill wipe samples that is most correlated with blood lead concentration, whereas lead concentration (micrograms per gram) is the best variable derived from carpet vacuum samples. the variation of dust lead levels for these three dust variables (floor lead loading, windowsill lead loading, and carpet lead concentration) are consistent with the variation of blood lead levels, showing the highest levels in the hottest months of the year, june, july, and august. the regression analysis, including the three representative dust variables in the equations to predict blood lead concentration, suggests that the seasonality of blood lead levels in children is related to the seasonal distributions of dust lead in the home. in addition, the outdoor activity patterns indicate that children are likely to contact high leaded street dust or soil during longer outdoor play periods in summer. consequently, our results show that children appear to receive the highest dust lead exposure indoors and outdoors during the summer, when they have the highest blood lead levels. we conclude that at least some of the seasonal variation in blood lead levels in children is probably due to increased exposure to lead in dust and soil.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

mechanisms underlying children's susceptibility to environmental toxicants,"an important public health challenge has been the need to protect children's health. to accomplish this goal, the scientific community needs scientifically based child-specific risk assessment methods. critical to their development is the need to understand mechanisms underlying children's sensitivity to environmental toxicants. risk is defined as the probability of adverse outcome and when applied to environmental risk assessment is usually defined as a function of both toxicity and exposure. to adequately evaluate the potential for enhanced health risks during development, both child-specific factors affecting toxicity and exposure need to be considered. in the first section of this article, example mechanisms of susceptibility relevant for toxicity assessment are identified and discussed. in the second section, examples of exposure factors that help define children's susceptibility are presented. examples of pesticide research from the newly funded child health center at the university of washington will be given for illustration. the final section discusses the importance of putting these considerations of children's susceptibility into an overall framework for ascertaining relevancy for human risk assessment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,University of washington mentioned but not focus of study,,,
housing and health - current issues and implications for research and programs,"this article provides an overview of the ways in which the home environment can affect human health, describes how specific health hazards in housing are related, and considers implications of these concerns for research and programs to address the health-housing connection. the widespread availability of decent housing has contributed greatly to improvements in health status in developed countries through, for example, provision of safe drinking water, proper sewage disposal, and protection from the elements. however, a lack of decent housing and homelessness among a significant number of americans remains a significant public health concern. in addition, a number of specific health hazards can be found even in housing that is in good condition and provides all basic amenities. specific health hazards related to housing include unintentional injuries, exposure to lead, exposure to allergens that may cause or worsen asthma, moisture and fungi (mold), rodent and insect pests, pesticide residues, and indoor air pollution. a number of these specific hazards share underlying causes, such as excess moisture, and all may be influenced by factors in the community environment or by occupant behaviors. we make recommendations for developing programs and research efforts that address multiple housing problems in an integrated way, rather than categorically, and for closer collaboration between housing and public health programs.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
environmental health screening with gis: creating a community environmental health profile,"in many communities, health care providers, public health officials, community groups, and individual citizens are concerned about potential connections between the environment and public health. the relationship between health outcomes and the environment is complex: and information in the form of a community profile can help concerned parties begin to understand how the environment may be affecting public health. for this study, a profile was created with data on population and economic characteristics, environmental sources, and public health outcomes. the data were drawn from local, state, and national sources in a geographic information system (gis) format. a critical component of this process was the collection of patient household data with an environmental health exposure form. the form was developed in a pilot project supported by the u.s. environmental protection agency, a community environmental health profile could be used on a limited basis for hypothesis building and as a catalyst for obtaining more information about individual patients, families, or neighborhoods. general relationships between the environment and health outcome data could be observed, and suggestions made for follow-up analyses and studies, health care providers and public health officials could use data obtained from a gis based profile, along with data gathered from patients, to examine potential environmental exposures in a community and to justify screening tests or other interventions, in addition, profiling of neighborhoods according to environment-related health outcomes could help with medical diagnosis and treatment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
limited seasonality effects on blood lead for a small cohort of female adults and children,"many blood lead surveys, especially during the 1970s and 1980s have shown variations of up to 35% in blood lead concentration, with higher values in summer over winter. we have monitored 13 adult females and seven children for periods from 348 to 1337 days as non-pregnant controls in a longitudinal study of mobilization of lead from the maternal skeletal during pregnancy and lactation. samples of blood, 6-day duplicate diet and environmental samples were analyzed by high-precision thermal ionization mass spectrometry for lead isotope ratios and lead concentrations. there was no statistically significant difference between seasons for brood lead concentrations and dietary intake although there were small differences in the isotopic composition for blood. one explanation for the lack of a seasonal effect in blood lead of our cohort may be the absence of climatic extremes in sydney. the minimal effects from seasonality observed in this cohort make this an especially useful cohort within which to study effects that could be obscured by seasonal factors.

lightening the lead load in children,"more than 4 percent of preschool-aged children in the united states have blood lead levels above 10 mu g per dl (0.50 mu mol per l), and these levels have been associated with a decline in iq. the centers for disease control and prevention advocates the use of a screening questionnaire to identify lead exposure or toxicity in all children. primary prevention through the removal of lead from gasoline and paint has led to a reduction of blood lead levels in children, secondary prevention through paint hazard remediation is effective in homes that have a high lead burden. children with lead levels of 45 to 69 mu g per dl (2.15 to 3.35 mu mol per l) should receive chelation therapy using succimer (dmsa) or edetate calcium disodium (cana2edta), use of both cana2edta and dimercaprol (bal in oil) is indicated in children with blood lead levels higher than 70 mu g per dl (3.40 mu mol per l). current treatment recommendations are based on the reduction of blood lead levels, which may not represent a significant overall reduction of the lead burden. clinical trials of existing agents are needed to determine patient-oriented outcomes, such as the effect on iq.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

ecological and human health risks at an outdoor firing range,"this is the first report in the refereed literature of a quantitative ecological and human health risk assessment at an outdoor recreational shooting range. contaminants of concern (coc) included lead, other metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) associated with the clay targets on the shotgun range. ecological receptors included raptors, deer, foxes, birds, and small mammals. the risk associated with potential incidental ingestion of lead shot by mammals was estimated for the first time. with the exception of lead, risks were minimal to all ecological receptors from all coc acting through all exposure pathways. lead posed minimal risk to raptors, foxes, or deer. lead in dietary items posed a small risk to individual birds. the only substantive risk was to individual small mammals and grit-ingesting birds from the incidental ingestion of lead shot within the shotfall zone at the trap and skeet range. although effects associated with lead ingestion may occur at the level of individual organisms. ecological impacts are not expected at the population, community, or ecosystem level. this is because density-dependent compensation mechanisms would likely offset any site-related loss of a few individuals that might occur. human receptors included shooters, range workers, and trespassers. cancer risks to all receptors from all coc via all exposure pathways were less than 10(-4), generally considered an acceptable upper bound excess lifetime cancer risk to an individual. the only noncarcinogenic risk of hq > 1 was associated with inhalation of copper by those engaged in the voluntary activity of shooting. two approaches were taken to modeling blood lead in children associated with intermittent exposure. under the most likely exposure scenario, the mean bleed lead level of trespassing children was approx. 2 mu g/dl, with less than 1% of children exceeding the 10-mu g/dl level of concern. higher blood lead levels could be possible if children were to trespass in off-limit areas of the shooting range.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
potential effectiveness of parents' actions to reduce children's lead exposure,"there have been few descriptive studies of parents' efforts to decrease children's exposure to lead. from parents who brought their children to 6 public lead-screening clinics and agreed to participate in a larger study of lead-exposure patterns, a purposeful sample (n = 125) was selected. the children of these parents had at least 1 lead-exposure risk factor, based on parental report. on a questionnaire, only 30% of the parents documented either the child's sources of possible lead exposure, their actions to reduce exposure, or both. documenting an exposure source was significantly associated with documenting an action. documenting exposure sources and documenting actions were both associated with prior knowledge of lead's risks; these relationships were influenced by the child's history of prior lead screening. parent's reported actions to reduce exposure were categorized for potential effectiveness in relation to the child's risk factors; very few actions were considered effective. results suggest that parents need information to help them identify sources of lead exposure and to minimize their children's risks.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead isotopes as a supplementary tool in the routine evaluation of household lead hazards,"the advent of magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (icp-ms) allows rapid, accurate, and precise measurement of lead isotopes in environmental and biological samples at a lower cost than traditional methods. this may increase the feasibility of including lead isotope measurements as a routine tool to identify household sources of lead exposure to children. here, we present three household case studies to illustrate how lead hazard evaluations by an environmental specialist could be supplemented with routine lead isotope analyses of potential lead sources and blood. sampling for lead isotopes was undertaken following the u.s. department of housing and urban development regulatory guidelines for the evaluation of lead hazards in housing, and with the consideration of minimizing the additional costs associated with lead isotope measurements. the range of isotopic ratios within a single residence was large enough to allow the characterization of different lead sources, particularly when both major (e.g., (207)pb/(206)pb) and minor (e.g., (206)pb/(204)pb) isotope ratios were considered. these cases illustrate the utility of the lead isotope method to identify main source(s) of lead exposure to the child; discard unlikely sources of exposure to the child; point to sources of lead to dust; and substantiate or refine the environmental assessment based exclusively on lead concentrations and loadings. thus, a more effective evaluation of household lead hazards would likely benefit from considering a) lead concentrations and loadings in and around the household environment; b) all isotopic ratios of potential lead sources within that environment; and c) information about behavioral habits, as well as an evaluation of viable pathways of exposure to the child.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

dietary exposure of children in lead-laden environments,"children are the most susceptible population to lead exposure because of three interacting factors; they have more opportunity for contact with lead sources due to their activities, lead absorption occurs more readily in a child compared to an adult, and the child's development is more vulnerable to lead than adults. low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to cause adverse health effects; the level of concern for children is currently 10 mug/dl. the contribution of dietary exposure of lead to increased blood lead levels (pbb) is not well characterized. this study was conducted to measure potential dietary lead intakes of children 2 to 3 years of age who live in homes contaminated with environmental lead. objectives were to estimate lead intakes for children consuming food in contaminated environments, recognizing unstructured eating patterns and to investigate if correlations exist between daily dietary exposure and measured pbb. dietary exposure was evaluated by collecting samples that were typical of the foods the young children ate in their homes. a 24-h duplicate of all foods plus sentinel foods, i.e., individual items used to represent foods contaminated during handling, were collected from 48 children. ten homes were revisited to obtain information on the variation in daily dietary intakes. drinking water was evaluated both as part of the segregated beverage sample composite and by itself. additional information collected included lead concentrations from hand wipes, floor wipes, and venous blood, and questionnaire responses from the caregiver on activities potentially related to exposure. activities and hygiene practices of the children and contamination of foods in their environment influences total dietary intake. estimated mean dietary intakes of lead (29.2 mug pb/day) were more than three times the measured 24-h duplicate-diet levels (8.37 mug pb/day), which were almost six times higher than current national estimates (1.40 mug pb/day). statistically significant correlations were observed between floor wipes and foods contacting contaminated surfaces, hand wipes and foods contacting contaminated hands and surfaces, and hand wipes and floor wipes. this study indicates that the dietary pathway of exposure to lead is impacted by eating activities of children living in lead-contaminated environments and that analysis of foods themselves is not enough to determine excess dietary exposures that are occurring.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

recommendations for blood lead screening of young children enrolled in medicaid: targeting a group at high risk,"children aged 1-5 years enrolled in medicaid are at increased risk for having elevated blood lead levels (blls). according to estimates from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) (1991-1994), medicaid enrollees accounted for 83% of u.s. children aged 1-5 years who had blls > or = 20 microg/dl. despite longstanding requirements for blood lead screening in the medicaid program, an estimated 81% of young children enrolled in medicaid had not been screened with a blood lead test. as a result, most children with elevated blls are not identified and, therefore, do not receive appropriate treatment or environmental intervention. to ensure delivery of blood lead screening and follow-up services for young children enrolled in medicaid, the advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention (acclpp) recommends specific steps for health-care providers and states. health-care providers and health plans should provide blood lead screening and diagnostic and treatment services for children enrolled in medicaid, consistent with federal law, and refer children with elevated blls for environmental and public health follow-up services. states should change policies and programs to ensure that young children enrolled in medicaid receive the screening and follow-up services to which they are legally entitled. toward this end, states should a) ensure that their own medicaid policies comply with federal requirements, b) support health-care providers and health plans in delivering screening and follow-up services, and c) ensure that children identified with elevated blls receive essential, yet often overlooked, environmental follow-up care. states should also monitor screening performance and blls among young children enrolled in medicaid. finally, states should implement innovative blood lead screening strategies in areas where conventional screening services have been insufficient. this report provides recommendations for improved screening strategies and relevant background information for health-care providers, state health officials, and other persons interested in improving the delivery of lead-related services to young children served by medicaid.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
elevated blood lead levels and blood lead screening among us children aged one to five years: 1988-1994,"objectives: to estimate the proportion of children 1 to 5 years of age who received blood lead testing during 1988-1994 and to assess whether predictors of testing coincided with predictors of elevated blood lead levels. design: cross-sectional analysis of data from the third national health and nutrition examination survey. participants. us children 1 to 5 years of age. outcome measures. prevalence of blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels among children 1 to 5 years of age and odds ratios for factors predicting blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels. results: overall, 6.3% had elevated blood lead levels and 10.2% had undergone previous blood lead tests. being of minority race/ethnicity, living in an older home, residing in the northeast or midwest regions of the united states, being on medicaid, having a head of household with <12 years of education, and having a history of anemia were significant factors in both models. additional independent risk factors for an elevated blood lead level included being sampled in phase 1 of the survey, being 1 to 2 years of age, not having a regular doctor, and being sampled during the summer months. additional independent correlates of a previous blood lead test included having moved less than twice in one's lifetime, having a female head of household, and having parents whose home language was english. of an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age who had elevated blood lead levels and no previous screening test in 1993, 62% were receiving medicaid, 40% lived in homes built before 1946, and 34% were black, non-hispanic. conclusions: lead screening was more frequent among children with risk factors for lead exposure. however, among children with elevated blood lead levels, only one third had been tested previously. in 1993 an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age had elevated blood lead levels but were never screened. physicians should screen medicaid-eligible children and should follow state or local health department recommendations about identifying and screening other at-risk children. in areas where no health department guidelines exist, physicians should screen all children or screen based on known risk factors.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
pediatric lead poisoning: is there a threshold?,"a recurrent theme in research on childhood lead poisoning has been the discovery time and again over the past 40 years that lead is toxic to the developing nervous system at levels previously thought to be safe. in the 1960s an elevated pediatric lead level was defined as a concentration in whole blood of greater than or equal to 60 micrograms per deciliter ( mu g/dl). the effect of lead on children was viewed at that time as a simple either/or phenomenon: either a child was clinically poisoned, or the child was well. there was no in-between. then, beginning in the 1970s with the work of herbert needleman and others, the recognition grew that lead could reduce children's intelligence and alter behavior at blood lead levels (blls) lower than 60 mu g/dl, that is, at levels insufficient to produce clinically obvious symptoms. thus was born the concept of """"subclinical lead poisoning,"""" based on an understanding that lead produces a spectrum of toxicity in which clinical symptoms such as encephalopathy, renal failure, and anemia have their subclinical counterparts in lowered intelligence, impaired function of the renal tubules, and elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin. continued exploration of subclinical lead poisoning using stronger study designs and sharper analytic tools has continued to show that lead is toxic to children at even lower levels. as these data came in, the us public health service repeatedly reduced the level of lead in blood that defined childhood lead poisoning. thus in 1971 the level was reduced to 40 mu g/dl, in 1978 it was reduced to 30 mu g/dl, and in 1985, it was reduced to 25 mu g/dl. most recently, in 1991, the level was reduced to 10 mu g/dl. this last reduction followed the demonstration in multiple prospective epidemiologic studies that prenatal exposures to lead could have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development in young children at blls as low as 10 mu g/dl to 20 mu g/dl. now, in this issue of public health reports, the report by lanphear and colleagues suggests that lead may exert toxicity at concentrations in sharply with current efforts that rely almost exclusively on management of children with elevated blood lead levels.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
use of geographic information system technology to aid health department decision making about childhood lead poisoning prevention activities,"the centers for disease control and prevention recommend that local public health agencies use local data to identify children at risk for lead exposure to ensure that they receive preventive services. the objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of a geographic information system (gis) in identifying children at risk for lead exposure. we conducted a descriptive study, using gis technology, of the blood lead (bpb) levels and residential location of at-risk children screened for lead exposure. """"""""at-risk children"""""""" were defined as those children living in housing built before 1950 or in an area with a high proportion of older housing. the study was conducted in jefferson county, kentucky, usa. participants were the cohort of children born in 1995 and screened from 1996 through 1997, and children younger than age 7 years who were screened from 1994 through 1998. outcome measures were the bpb level and residential location (address or target zone) of at-risk children screened from 1996 through 1997, and the number and location of homes where more than one child had been poisoned by lead from 1994 through 1998. the proportion of children screened who live within zones targeted for universal screening varied from 48% to 53%, while only 50% of the at-risk children in the entire county were screened. between 1994 and 1998, 79 homes housed 35% of the 524 children with lead poisoning. these housing units were prioritized for lead-hazard remediation. significant numbers of at-risk children throughout the county were not being tested for lead exposure, even in prioritized areas. gis can be very useful to health departments in planning lead exposure screening strategies and measuring program performance.",kentucky,kentucky,1,,policy,screening,NA
"dorchester lead-safe yard project: a pilot program to demonstrate low-cost, on-site techniques to reduce exposure to lead-contaminated soil","despite a general reduction in blood lead levels in children after lead was banned in gasoline and paint, lead poisoning remains an important health problem in many older urban areas. one factor that increases risk in these places is the high levels of lead in certain residential areas. a major intervention study found that reducing lead levels in urban soils results in a reduction in exposed children's blood lead levels. removing lead from inner-city soils or reducing exposures to lead-contaminated soils typically is expensive, technologically challenging, or beyond the ability of low-income households to undertake. this project, in conjunction with residents and community-based institutions, developed a series of in situ, low-cost, low-technology measures that worked to reduce the exposure to lead-contaminated soils in one boston, massachusetts, neighborhood. the project demonstrated several important results. government, universities, residents, and community based organizations can work together effectively to reduce exposures to lead in soil. lead-contaminated soil can be mitigated at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods in ways that increase the ability of residents, community health centers, and others to have a positive impact on their neighborhoods. a lead-safe yard program can be replicated and institutionalized by municipal home de-leading programs and other community organizations.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,environment,abatement,outdoor
"trends in blood lead levels among children--boston, massachusetts, 1994-1999","data from the national health and nutrition examination survey and national childhood blood lead surveillance data from 19 states indicated that average blood lead levels (blls) in young children decreased during the late 1990s (1-3). the proportion of children tested who had blls >10 microg/dl declined from 10.5% in 1996 to 7.6% in 1998, although the proportion was higher in certain counties (3). to determine whether a similar decline had occurred in boston, massachusetts, where a high proportion of children are tested each year, and whether any changes were similar in high- and low-risk neighborhoods, cdc, in collaboration with the boston childhood lead poisoning prevention program (bclppp) performed an analysis of blls among children aged 6-72 months in boston during 1994-1999. the results indicate that blls in boston declined during this period, but because of the geographic variation in lead exposure, continued surveillance will be necessary to eliminate childhood lead poisonings.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,exploratory,screening,NA
the effects of home lead abatements on childhood blood lead levels: a retrospective follow-up study,"home abatement is the environmental intervention most commonly mandated by law for children with lead poisoning. previous studies of abatement efficacy, however, have yielded inconsistent results and have left doubt about the long-term effectiveness of this intervention in reducing children's blood lead levels. for this study, the authors analyzed 488 children six years old or less who had been reported to the new jersey department of health and senior services from 1993 to 1997 with blood lead levels of 30 to 44 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dl); each of the children analyzed also had a follow-up blood lead test at least two months after abatement if an abatement was completed, or two months after baseline if an abatement was not completed. although home abatements were recommended for all children, they were not completed in 118 cases. a significant difference (p < .01) was seen in the mean declines of blood lead levels between children in abated homes (-10.1 mug/dl, or -28.5 percent) and those in unabated homes (-7.3 mug/dl, or -20.8 percent). this difference was partially due to longer follow up in the group that received abatement. when this difference was adjusted in a multiple regression for age, time to follow up, baseline blood lead level, socioeconomic factors, and season-with time to follow-up restricted to 70-400 days-the overall difference in decline of blood lead levels decreased from 7.7 percent to two percent, when the same restriction was applied,vith adjustment for the same confounders in a logistic regression and the probability of a decline of >4 mug/dl was modeled, abatement had minimal effect (odds ratio = 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval = 0.7, 2.5), thus, lead paint abatements, as required in new jersey from 1993 to 1997, are of only modest efficacy in reducing children's blood lead levels. stronger regulations, better enforcement, and more attention to lead-contaminated dust should be evaluated as ways of better protecting lead-exposed children.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,structure,abatement,NA
the development of a stochastic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for lead,"this presentation describes the development of a prototype monte carlo module for the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model for lead, created by dr ellen o'flaherty. the module uses distributions for the following: exposure parameters (soil and dust concentrations, daily soil and ingestion rate, water lead concentration, water ingestion rate, air lead concentration, inhalation rate and dietary lead intake); absoption parameters; and key pharmacokinetic parameters (red blood binding capacity and half saturation concentration). distributions can be specified as time-invariant or can change with age. monte carlo model predicted blood levels were calibrated to empirically measured blood lead levels for children living in midvale, utah (a milling/smelting community). the calibrated model was then evaluated using blood lead data from palmerton, pennsylvania (a town with a former smelter) and sandy, utah, (a town with a former smelter and slag piles). our initial evaluation using distributions for exposure parameters showed that the model accurately predicted geometric (gm) blood lead levels of palmerton and sandy and slightly over predicted the gsd. consideration of uncertainty in red blood cell parameters substantially inflated the gm. future model development needs to address the correlation among parameters and the use of parameters for long-term exposure derived from short-term studies.

"lead poisoning among refugee children resettled in massachusetts, 1995 to 1999","objective. lead poisoning has been reported among immigrant and refugee populations in the united states; however, prevalences of elevated blood lead (bpb) and risk factors have not been described fully among newly arrived refugee children. this study was conducted to address this lack of data. methods. we performed analysis of bpb levels among a cohort of refugee children, aged <7 years, who arrived in massachusetts between july 1, 1995, and december 31, 1999. gender, age, birthplace, time of year of lead testing, intestinal parasitoses, anemia, and growth retardation were examined as predictors of elevated bpb. results. bpb levels <greater than or equal to>10 mg/dl were found in 11.3% of 693 children shortly after their arrival in the united states. children from developing countries had the highest prevalences, including 27% of somalis and vietnamese. country of birth was the strongest predictor of elevated bpb. no association between elevated lead and age was found. among 213 children with bpb tests greater than or equal to6 months after the initial test, 7% had newly elevated levels of greater than or equal to 10 mug/dl. conclusions. the prevalence of elevated bpb levels in recently arrived refugee children is more than twice that of us-born children. children who are at particular risk are those from developing countries where environmental exposures are more ubiquitous. in addition, a significant percentage of refugees acquired elevated levels after arrival, thus suggesting the importance of follow-up testing of refugee children. refugee status should be considered a risk factor for lead poisoning.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,refugee,refugee/immigrant,NA
a statewide assessment of lead screening histories of preschool children enrolled in a medicaid managed care program,"objectives: despite the prominence of lead poisoning as a public health problem, recent government accounting office reports indicate that only one fifth of children who are covered by medicaid have been screened for lead poisoning. the purpose of this study was to examine the lead screening histories of children who were enrolled in a statewide, medicaid managed care plan to determine the relative impact of the type of primary care provider site and family sociodemographic characteristics on the likelihood of being screened. the study also examined the prevalence of and risk factors for lead poisoning of children who had been screened. methods: a random sample of 2000 preschool-age children was chosen from those who were enrolled continuously in the statewide, expanded, medicaid managed care program for a 1-year period and between the ages of 19 and 35 months at the end of that year. sociodemographic characteristics and lists of primary care providers were obtained from administrative data sets. medical record audits at primary care provider sites were performed to obtain the lead screening histories of the children, including test dates and results. results: data on 1988 children were used for study analyses, and 80% of these children had at least 1 documented blood lead level. children whose primary care provider was an office-based physician were less likely to be screened as compared with patients of health centers, hospital-based clinics, and staff model health maintenance organizations (68%, 86%, 89%, and 91% respectively). variation in screening rates persisted in a multivariate analysis controlling for family sociodemographic characteristics and practice level variation. of the 1587 children who had a documented blood lead test, 467 children (29%) had a blood lead level of >/=10 mg/dl on at least 1 test. conclusions: blood lead screening rates in rhode island's medicaid managed care program are dramatically higher than national estimates for children who are enrolled in medicaid. potential explanations for this finding are 1) a high sensitization to the problem of lead poisoning in rhode island, 2) the primary care focus of the medicaid program in rhode island facilitates the delivery of preventive services, and 3) the medical record audit approach used in this study was more comprehensive in identifying blood lead screens than techniques used in national studies. the high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels found in this study emphasizes the importance of screening among children who are enrolled in medicaid.",rhode island,rhode island,1,,sociodemographic,screening,NA
should we screen for lead poisoning after 36 months of age? experience in the inner city,"introduction.-current lead screening guidelines recommend monitoring lead levels in children under 3 years of age. there are, however. a number of children between the ages of 3 and 6 years who have elevated blood lead levels. whether these lead elevations are new or chronic has not been examined. objective.-to determine the proportion of children with lead levels greater than or equal to 10 mug/dl after their third birthday when all prior testing had been normal. methods.-retrospective study based on 39 000 venous lead tests obtained between 1993 and 1998, front this group, 2046 children were located who had blood lead levels of less than 10 mug/dl before 36 months and who had a followup lead level after 36 months. all lead assays were done by the city of new york laboratories. which had an intrasample variability of 13%. results.-sixty-six (3.2%) of the 2046 children showed an elevation in blood lead for the first time after their third birthday. the abnormal values ranged from 10 to 25 mug/dl. the majority (72%) of the screen-positive children, however, had lead levels of 10 to 12 mug/dl, and 63.3% of screen-positive children with repeat tests had lead levels that reverted to below 10 mug/dl. conclusions.-the data indicate that some new cases of lead level elevations did occur after 3 years of age in this 'high-risk' community, however, the current study provides evidence that universal screening for lead poisoning beyond 3 years of age is not warranted in this community as it is not likely to pick lip clinically important exposure.",new york,new york,1,,screening,screening,NA
multiple metal contamination from house paints: consequences of power sanding and paint scraping in new orleans,"power sanding exterior paint is a common practice during repainting of old houses in new orleans, louisiana, that triggers lead poisoning and releases more than pb. in this study we quantified the pb, zinc, cadmium, manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium, and vanadium in exterior paint samples collected from new orleans homes (n = 31). we used interior dust wipes to compare two exterior house-painting projects. house i was measured in response to the plight of a family after a paint contractor power sanded all exterior paint from the weatherboards. the ph content (similar to 130,000 mug pb/g) was first realized when the family pet died; the children were hospitalized, the family was displaced, and cleanup costs were high. to determine the quantity of dust generated by power sanding and the benefits of reducing pb-contaminated dust, we tested a case study house (house 2) for pb (similar to 90,000 mug/g) before the project was started; the house was then dry scraped and the paint chips were collected. although the hazards of pb-based paints are well known, there are other problems as well, because other toxic metals exist in old paints. if house 2 had been power sanded to bare wood like house 1, the repainting project would have released as dust about 7.4 hg pb, 3.5 kg zn, 9.7 g cd, 14.8 g cu, 8.8 g mn, 1.5 g ni, 5.4 g co, 2.4 g cr, and 0.3 g v. the total tolerable daily intake (ttdi) for a child under 6 years of age is 6 mug ph from all sources. converting 7.4 kg pb to this scale is vexing-more than 1 billion (10(9)) times the ttdi. also for perspective, the one-time release of 7.4 x 10(9) mug of plo dust from sanding compares to 50 x 10(9) mug of ph dust emitted annually per 0.1 mile (0.16 km) from street traffic during the peak use of leaded gasoline. in this paper, we broaden the discussion to include an array of metals in paint sind underscore the need and possibilities for curtailing the release of metal dust.",louisiana,louisiana,1,,structure,residential,NA

further comparisons of empirical and epidemiological data with predictions of the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children,"observed blood lead levels for young children from several communities are compared with blood lead levels predicted for those communities using the usepa's integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model. in contrast to the comparisons described elsewhere, the blood lead levels observed in the communities considered here are not well represented by the model's predictions. the model's predictions for midvale, ut; sandy, ut; cincinnati, oh; and a recent data set for palmerton, pa, show considerable deviation from observation both for the geometric mean blood lead level and the percent of blood lead levels above 10 mug/dl. various adjustments in the model to consider play area soils, site-specific geometric standard deviations and the time children spend away from their homes do not substantially improve the comparisons to observation. it is difficult to predict a priori the data sets for which the model will yield adequate predictions. this reduces the value of the model for use in communities where blood lead measurements have not been made, and suggests that caution should be exercised when using the model to set soil lead cleanup levels or to predict the result of remediation.",pennsylvania,pennsylvania,1,,biology,model,NA
evaluation of public housing lead risk assessment data,"a unique data set from lead risk assessments performed on 67 public housing developments from across the united states was made available for analyzes. the data set includes results of lead analysis from 5906 dust wipes and from 1222 soil samples. a total of 487 dwelling units in these developments, as well as associated common areas, were sampled, all by the same team of inspectors. the number of dwelling units within a development that were sampled reflected the guidelines then in force, the 1990 interim hud guidelines, rather than those specified in the 1995 guidelines. median dust lead loadings for floors, 151 mug m(-2) (14 mug ft(-2)), and window sills, 936 mug m(-2) (87 mug ft(-2)), were much less than former hud limits of 1076 mug m(-2) (100 mug ft(-2)) and 5380 mug m(-2) (500 mug ft(-2)), respectively and are only about one-third of the recently established limits of 431 mug m(-2) (40 mug ft(-2)) and 2690 mug m(-2) (250 mug ft(-2)). in contrast, the median lead loading for window troughs, 8560 mug m(-2) (795 mug ft(-2)), was almost identical to the hud clearance limit of 8610 mug m(-2) (800 mug ft(-2)). there was a strong positive correlation between floor and window trough lead loading values for samples from the same dwelling units and those from common areas of the housing developments. door threshold samples, which may reflect conditions exterior to the dwelling unit, were collected from 53 dwelling units. median lead loading levels of these samples were more than ten times higher than those in floor samples from the same dwelling units, were about the same as window sill samples and about one-half of levels in window trough samples. composite sample results, simulated by averaging results from four samples within a dwelling unit, revealed that in order to have the same rate of excedence of standards, the composite standards would have to be reduced, for example, from the single sample value of 1076 mug m(-2) (100 mug ft(-2)) to 527 mug m(-2) (49 mug ft(-2)) for floor samples and from the single sample value of 8610 mug m(-2) (800 mug ft(-2)) to 5160 mug m(-2) (479 mug ft(-2)) for window troughs. for this public housing data set, the portion of the units in developments containing more than 225 units which exceeded the established limit for window samples was the same when using either the full data set or a random one-half of the data set. this suggests that, for this data set, the number of dwelling units sampled was excessive . thus, the required increase in the number of dwelling units to be sampled specified in the 1995 guidelines for developments with more than 225 dwelling units, may not have been necessary if this data set is representative of public housing developments in the united states.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

contribution of lead from calcium supplements to blood lead,"we conducted a case-control study to determine the contribution of lead to blood from consumption of calcium supplements approximating the recommended daily intakes over a 6-month period. subjects were males and females ages 21 to 47 years (geometric mean 32 years) with a geometric mean blood lead concentration of 2.5 mu g/dl. they were subdivided into three groups. one treatment group (n = 8) was administered a complex calcium supplement (carbonate/phosphate/citrate) and the other treatment group (n = 7) calcium carbonate. the control group (n = 6) received no supplement. the lead isotopic compositions of the supplements were completely different from those of the blood of the subjects, allowing us easily to estimate contribution from the supplements. the daily lead dose from the supplements at 100% compliance was about 3 mu g pb. three blood samples were taken at 2-month intervals before treatment to provide background values, and three were taken during treatment. subjects in the treatment group were thus their own controls. lead isotopic compositions for the complex supplement showed minimal change during treatment compared with pretreatment. lead isotopic compositions in blood for the calcium carbonate supplement showed increases of up to 0.5% in the super(206)pb/ super(204)pb ratio, and for all isotope ratios there was a statistically significant difference between baseline and treatment (p < 0.005). the change from baseline to treatment for the calcium carbonate supplement differed from that for both the control group and the group administered the complex supplement. blood lead concentrations, however, showed minimal changes. variations in blood lead levels over time did not differ significantly between groups. our results are consistent with earlier investigations using radioactive and stable lead tracers, which showed minimal gastrointestinal absorption of lead in the presence of calcium ( plus or minus phosphorus) in adults. even though there is no discernible increase in blood lead concentration during treatment, there are significant changes in the isotopic composition of lead in blood arising from the calcium carbonate supplement, indicating a limited input of lead from diet into the blood. because calcium carbonate is overwhelmingly the most popular calcium supplement, the changes we have observed merit further investigation. in addition, this type of study, combined with a duplicate diet, needs to be repeated for children, whose fractional absorption of lead is considerably higher than that of adults.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Adult study,,,
longitudinal study of daily intake and excretion of lead in newly born infants,"as an adjunct to a study of lead mobilization during pregnancy and lactation, we have obtained estimates of the daily lead intake and excretion/intake for 15 newly born infants monitored for at least 6 months postpartum, the longitudinal data presented reflect the far lower levels of environmental contribution to lead in blood in the 1990's than that in the earlier studies from the 1970's and early 1980's, the last period for which such dietary information is available in newly born infants. infants were breast-fed or formula-fed or both and, in the second quarter, were usually fed solid foods (beikost). lead concentrations were as follows: lead in breast milk, ranged from 0.09 to 3.1 mug/kg with a geometric mean of 0.55 mug/kg, lead in infant formula ranged from 0.07 to 11.4 mug/kg with a geometric mean of 1.6 mug/kg, and lead in beikost ranged from 1.1 to 27 mug/kg with a geometric mean of 2.9 mug/kg. daily lead intakes ranged from 0.04 to 0.83 mug/kg body weight/day with a geometric mean of 0.23 mug pb/kg body weight/day, and excretion/intake ranged from 0.7 to 22 with a geometric mean of 2.6. there was no significant difference at the 5% level in lead concentration in daily intakes and excretion/intake for the first quarter versus the second quarter for this small number of subjects. assuming that there was no contribution from environmental samples such as house dust and ambient air, the contribution of diet to blood has been estimated from lead isotopic measurements with the following ranges: for breast milk only as the dietary source, 40 to 65%; for breast milk and infant formula as the dietary sources, 15 to 70%; and for infant formula and beikost, 20 to 80%, the geometric mean value of the dietary contribution to blood over the 6-month period of approximately 35% is consistent with earlier estimates of uptake of lead in blood in newly born infants when environmental lead concentrations were much higher, other sources such as air, soil, and dust are considered to contribute minimally to blood lead in these infants because of the low pb-206/pb-204 ratios in environmental media. thus, we consider that the increased excretion over intake, along with other evidence, reflects mobilization of infant tissues arising especially from rapid bone turnover at this stage of life; the tissue lead has been identified isotopically in urine.

seasonal variation in bone lead contribution to blood lead during pregnancy,"population blood lead level (pbb) often shows seasonal variation, frequently being higher in summer and lower in winter. as vitamin d metabolites also show seasonal variability, and the metabolites are associated with bone metabolism, some authors have posited a role for bone lead release in seasonal pbb changes. we made third trimester and postdelivery pbb measurements on 414 immigrant women (98% latina) in los angeles. we measured in vivo tibia and calcaneus (heel) lead concentration postdelivery via k-shell x-ray fluorescence. we saw evidence of seasonal variation in prenatal pbb, but not postnatal pbb. pbb was highest in spring and lowest in autumn. tibia lead concentration was associated with prenatal pbb, as reported before. the contribution of tibia lead to prenatal pbb varied seasonally, with the greatest contribution occurring in the winter quarter and the least in the summer quarter. the temporal pattern of bone lead contribution to pbb follows the seasonal alteration of insolation. there was no seasonal component in prenatal pbb associated with calcaneus lead, nor were there seasonal variations in either calcaneus or tibia lead contributions to postnatal pbb. bone turnover in the third trimester of pregnancy may be higher in winter months than in summer months, resulting in greater fetal lead exposure in spring than at other times of the year.

combining datasets to predict the effects of regulation of environmental lead exposure in housing stock,"a model for children's blood lead concentrations as a function of environmental lead exposures was developed by combining two nationally representative sources of data that characterize the marginal distributions of blood lead and environmental lead with a third regional dataset that contains joint measures of blood lead and environmental lead. the complicating factor addressed in this article was the fact that methods for assessing environmental lead were different in the national and regional datasets. relying on an assumption of transportability (that although the marginal distributions of blood lead and environmental lead may be different between the regional dataset and the nation as a whole, the joint relationship between blood lead and environmental lead is the same), the model makes use of a latent variable approach to estimate the joint distribution of blood lead and environmental lead nationwide.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead exposure in pregnancy: a review of the literature and argument for routine prenatal screening,"despite a steady decline in average blood lead levels in the u.s. population, approximately 0.5% of women of childbearing age may have blood levels exceeding 10 mug/dl. strong correlations between maternal and umbilical cord blood lead levels demonstrate that lead is transferred from the mother to the fetus. high lead levels are known to cause neurobehavioral effects in infants and children, and the cumulative effects of low levels of lead exposure in utero and after birth can have similar detrimental effects. modern sources of exposure include occupational exposure during automotive or aircraft paint manufacturing, lead production or smeltering, exposure to stained glass soder, and environmental exposure during home renovation. prenatal screening for lead exposure may include use of a five-item questionnaire similar to the pediatric questionnaire. management of prenatal lead exposure focuses on removal of the lead source. rarely, highly toxic chelation therapy is needed for maternal indications. recognition and removal of lead sources during the prenatal period can prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"a comparison of elevated blood lead levels among children living in foster care, their siblings, and the general population","objectives: to assess the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (eblls) among children before and after foster care placement, and to compare the prevalence of eblls among children in foster care with that of their siblings and the general population. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative databases from the philadelphia department of human services and the birth certificate registry and the childhood lead poisoning prevention program at the philadelphia department of public health. logistic regression analyses were performed to control for confounding variables, including age, race, gender, and the year, seasonal timing, and source (capillary vs venous) of test. results: from june 1992 to may 1997, there were 1824 children in foster care with available blood lead results in the childhood lead poisoning prevention program database. of these, 519 (28%) had initial lead screening before foster care placement and 654 (36%) after placement. there were 821 siblings and 73 608 children in the general population with available blood lead results. before entering foster care, children were nearly twice as likely to have eblls as their siblings (adjusted odds ratio [or] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.4, 2.0), those in placement (adjusted or = 1.9; 95% ci = 1.6, 2.2), and the general population (adjusted or = 1.7; 95% ci = 1.5, 2.0). at the highest point prevalence, 50% of children before placement had lead levels >/=20 microg/dl, and nearly 90% had levels >/=10 microg/dl. for all age categories, siblings of children in foster care placement had a higher prevalence of eblls than did the general population. after placement, children in foster care were nearly half as likely as the other groups to have eblls. conclusions: our findings suggest that children are at high risk for lead poisoning before entering foster care and that placement in foster care may have a beneficial effect on lead exposure. children before foster care placement are nearly twice as likely to have eblls compared with children in foster care placement, the general population, and their siblings. furthermore, siblings of children in foster care are at high risk for lead poisoning. children receiving social services in their own homes and children suffering from abuse and neglect should be actively screened for lead poisoning. greater efforts at preventing lead poisoning among these children must be made.",nongeographical,pennsylvania,0,Philidelphia,sociodemographic,NA,
evaluation of the hud lead hazard control grant program: early overall findings,"this study evaluates the effectiveness of lead hazard control methods used in the lead hazard control (lhc) grant program of u.s. department of housing and urban development. the lhc program awards funds to local jurisdictions to address lead hazards in privately owned, low-income dwellings. grantees in 14 cities, states, or counties collected environmental data in over 2600-treated dwellings making this the largest study of residential lead hazard control ever undertaken. grantees employed a range of treatments, the most common being replacement of windows and repair of deteriorated lead-based paint. in this paper, dust lead loading levels and blood lead levels of children (6 months-6 years, if present) were observed at four periods of time (preintervention, immediate, and 6- and 12-months postintervention) in 1212 dwellings. dust lead loading levels were also observed in a subset of these dwellings at 24- and 36-months postintervention. the geometric mean floor and window dust lead loadings declined at least 50 and 88% (p<0.0001), respectively, immediately postintervention. three years later, floor dust lead loadings remained at or below the immediate postintervention levels. window dust lead loadings had moderate increases, but remained substantially reduced from preintervention levels and below clearance standards. at 1 year after intervention, geometric mean age-adjusted blood lead levels had declined from 11.0 to 8.2 microg/dl, a 26% decline (p<0.0001). the lhc program interventions produced blood lead declines similar to or greater than the percentage changes reported in earlier 1-year lead intervention studies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
exposure of the inuit population of nunavik (arctic quebec) to lead and mercury,"the authors conducted a survey during 1992 to evaluate blood levels of lead and mercury in inuit adults of nunavik (arctic quebec, canada). blood samples obtained from 492 participants (209 males and 283 females; mean age = 35 yr) were analyzed for lead and total mercury; mean (geometric) concentrations were 0.42 micromol/l (range = 0.04-2.28 micromol/l) and 79.6 nmol/l (range = 4-560 nmol/l), respectively. concentrations of omega-3 fatty acid in plasma phospholipids--a biomarker of marine food consumption--were correlated with mercury (r = .56, p < .001) and, to a lesser extent, with blood lead levels (r = .31, p < .001). analyses of variance further revealed that smoking, age, and consumption of waterfowl were associated with lead concentrations (r2 = .30, p < .001), whereas age and consumption of seal and beluga whale were related to total mercury levels (r2 = .30, p < .001). a significant proportion of reproductive-age women had lead and mercury concentrations that exceeded those that have been reportedly associated with subtle neurodevelopmental deficits in other populations.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
contribution of children's activities to lead contamination of food,"this study evaluates the relationship of children's hygiene habits and food-handling behaviors on lead levels on hands and handled foods for toddlers living in lead-contaminated homes. forty-eight inner city toddlers previously identified as having elevated blood lead levels participated in three consecutive days of designated food-handling activities. during the visits, duplicate diets were obtained, the child handled a banana, a hot dog, and had his/her hands wiped with a moist towelette. in addition, wipe samples were collected from the kitchen floor, and food items were deposited on and subsequently collected from the kitchen floor. all samples were analyzed for lead. the child's caregiver completed a questionnaire, which addressed the child's hygiene and eating behaviors. it was demonstrated that children's contact with residential dust containing lead can transfer lead to food. both lead in the home and on the children's hands contribute to the contamination of food, and hence potential dietary exposure. mean lead in handled bananas was 26 microg/kg and on hot dogs 65 microg/kg, and mean lead values on cheese and apple slices that had been on the floor were 119 and 215 microg/kg. in addition, the child's hygiene habits as reported by the parent indicate that lack of basic hygiene patterns within a high lead environment can contribute to children's dietary exposure to lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

estimated change in blood lead concentration in control populations,"investigators have conducted several studies to assess the effectiveness of lead hazard interventions in reducing children's blood lead levels. for practical and ethical reasons, many of these studies have not included control populations. it is, therefore, impossible for researchers to determine to what extent the reported decline in blood lead concentrations has resulted from intervention versus other factors. in the current retrospective analysis, the authors estimated the change in children's blood lead levels in control populations at 12-mo follow-up. the results suggest that an average 9% decline may be attributed to factors that are unrelated to intervention. declines of approximately 25% have been reported following several lead-hazard interventions. for these studies, the results of the authors' analysis suggest that approximately 16% of the decline is attributed directly to the intervention.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
pah and metal mixtures in new orleans soils and sediments,"the purpose of this study is to determine the degree of pah contamination and the association of pahs with inorganic substances in soils and sediments of new orleans. bonnet carre spillway (bcs) (n = 5) provides modern baseline data, while urban soil samples (cty) (n = 27) and sediment samples from bayou st. john (bsj) (n = 11) provide experimental data for new orleans. soil samples were collected from the top 2.5 cm of the surface, air-dried, and sieved (2 mm). sediments samples were collected with a wildco-ekman bottom dredge, air-dried and finely ground. accelerated solvent extraction (ase) was used to release pahs from the samples and analysis was conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). metals were extracted using a 5:1 ratio of 1 mol/l nitric acid (room temperature) for soil and sediment samples, shaken for 2 h, centrifuged (1000 x g for 15 min) and filtered. metal analysis was done by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (icp-a-es). mann-whitney tests show pah differences (p < 0.001). ranking of total pahs is, bsj sediments (10.3 mg/kg) > cty soils (3.7 mg/kg) > bcs alluvium (0.28 mg/kg). the sum of the metals are similar for bsj sediments (698 mg/kg) and cty soils (679 mg/kg) and significantly lower for bcs (189 mg/kg). manganese of these samples is similar for each site. for paired samples, pearson product moment correlation tests reveal that many pahs are strongly associated with each other at all locations. for bcs alluvium and bsj sediments, total pahs are not significantly associated with total metals. for cty, most pairs of metals are significantly associated, and total soil pahs are strongly associated with total soil metals (correlation 0.78, p = 4.9 x 10(-4)). the linear model, total soil pah = 136.3 + 6.25 (total soil metals) forms the basis for a predicted pah map of new orleans. previous empirical research demonstrates an association between soil lead and children's lead exposure. this study indicates that pahs are part of the soil mixture of accumulated substances and by-products of industrial society that presents exposure potential in cities.

prenatal exposure of the northern quebec iuit infants to environmental contaminants,"the inuit population residing in nunavik (northern quebec, canada) relies on species from the marine food web for subsistence and is therefore exposed to high doses of environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and methylmercury and to a lesser extent lead. in view of the neurotoxic properties of these substances following developmental exposure, we initiated, a study on infant development in this remote coastal population. here we report the magnitude of prenatal exposure to these contaminants and to selective nutrients in inuit mothers and their newborns who were recruited on the hudson bay coast. we conducted interviews during the women's pregnancies and at 1 and 11 months postpartum and collected biological samples for mercury, lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), and chlorinated pesticides analyses as well as selenium and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-pufa). cord blood, maternal blood, and maternal hair mercury concentrations averaged 18.5 mug/l, 10.4 mug/l, and 3.7 mug/g, respectively, and are similar to those found in the faroe islands but lower than those documented in the seychelles islands and new zealand cohorts. concentrations of pcb congener 153 averaged 86.9, 105.3, and 131.6 mug/kg (lipids) in cord plasma, maternal plasma, and maternal milk, respectively; prenatal exposure to pcbs in the nunavik cohort is similar to that reported in the dutch but much lower than those in other arctic cohorts. levels of n3-pufa in plasma phospholipids and selenium in blood are relatively high. the relatively low correlations observed between organochlorine and methylmercury concentrations may maker it easier to identify the specific developmental deficits attributable to each toxicant. similarly, the weak correlations noted between environmental contaminants and nutrients will facilitate the documentation of possible protective effects afforded by either n3-pufa or selenium against neurotoxic contaminants.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

"lead sources, behaviors, and socioeconomic factors in relation to blood lead of native american and white children: a community-based assessment of a former mining area","lead poisoning prevention requires knowledge of lead sources and of appropriate residential lead standards. data are severely lacking on lead sources for native american children, many of whom live in rural areas. further, the relation of mining waste to blood lead concentrations (bpbs) of rural children is controversial. in collaboration with the eight tribes of northeastern oklahoma, we assessed lead sources and their effects on bpbs for rural native american and white children living in a former mining region. venous blood lead, residential environmental (soil, dust, paint, water), and caregiver interview (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviors, socioeconomic conditions) data were obtained from a representative sample of 245 children 1-6 years of age. bpbs ranged from 1 to 24 mug/dl. there were no ethnic differences in bpbs (p = 0.48) nor any patterns of excess lead sources for native american or white children. multiple linear regression analyses indicated that mean soil lead, mean floor lead loading, mouthing behaviors, caregivers' education, and residence in former mining towns were all strongly associated with bpbs. logistic regression results showed mean floor dust lead loading >10.1 pg/ft(2) (odds ratio [or], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [0], 3.5-37.3), and yard soil lead >165.3 mg/kg (or, 4.1; ci, 1.3-12.4) were independently associated with bpbs greater than or equal to10 mug/dl. we also found strong interactions between soil lead and poverty (p = 0.005), and dust and soil sources (p = 0.02). our findings indicate that soil and dust lead derived largely from mining waste pose a health hazard to native american and white children, and that current residential dust lead standards are insufficient to adequately protect children. moreover, our finding that poor children are especially vulnerable to lead exposures suggests that residential standards should consider interactions among socioeconomic conditions and lead sources if environmental justice is to be achieved.",oklahoma,oklahoma,1,,sociodemographic,residential,both
mapping for prevention: gis models for directing childhood lead poisoning prevention programs,"environmental threats to children's health-especially low-level lead exposure-are complex and multifaceted; consequently, mitigation of these threats has proven costly and insufficient and has produced economic and racial disparities in exposure among populations. policy makers, public health officials, child advocates, and others currently lack the appropriate infrastructure to evaluate children's risk and exposure potential across a broad range of risks. unable to identify where the highest risk of exposure occurs, children's environmental health programs remain mitigative instead of preventive. in this article we use geographic information system spatial analysis of data from blood lead screening, county tax assessors, and the u.s. census to predict statistically based lead exposure risk levels mapped at the individual tax parcel unit in six counties in north carolina. the resulting model uses weighted risk factors to spatially locate modeled exposure zones, thus highlighting critical areas for targeted intervention. the methods presented here hold promise for application and extension to the other 94 north carolina counties and nationally, as well as to other environmental health risks.",north carolina,north carolina,1,,exploratory,sociodemographic,NA
lead-based paint health risk assessment in dependent children living in military housing,"objective: in children, lead can cause serious permanent damage as a neurotoxicant. the objectives of the study were to evaluate potential exposure to lead-based paint in family housing units at a typical u.s. military installation and determine blood lead (pbb) levels in children ages 6 years or younger residing in these housing units. methods: the authors conducted a risk assessment of 1,723 housing units and occupants at fort devens in massachusetts. data from the military dependent cohort was compared to estimates for the u.s. national population as reported from phase 1 of the third national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes iii). results: a total of 1992 individuals (1,009 males and 983 females) were screened for pbb, stratified into age groups, and separated into racial/ethnic categories. four (0.3%) dust samples and 59 (11.6%) internal and 298 (77.8%) external paint chip samples contained hazardous levels of lead. the geometric mean pbb concentration for people ages 1 year and older reported by nhanes iii was 2.8 micro g/dl, compared with 1.5 microg/dl for the military installation cohort (p<0.0001). pbb levels were higher for males than for females and higher for blacks than whites 6 years of age and older. hispanics had lower pbb concentrations for all age groups except for those ages 1-2.9 years. prevalence of pbb levels >10 microg/dl for all age groups was 1.6% in the military cohort, compared with 4.5% for the general population. for ages 1-2.9 years, no blacks or hispanics and 0.6% of whites had pbb levels >10 micro g/dl, compared with 21.6% of blacks, 10.1% of hispanics, and 8.5% of whites for the general population. for ages 3-5.99 years, 0.15% of blacks, 0% of hispanics, and 0.3% of whites had pbb levels > or = 10 microg/dl, compared with 20.0% of blacks, 6.8% of hispanics, and 3.7% of whites for the general population. conclusion: lead exposure for occupants of on-post military housing is much less than for those residing in the civilian sector.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,structure,residential,both

comparison of techniques to reduce residential lead dust on carpet and upholstery: the new jersey assessment of cleaning techniques trial,"high-efficiency particulate air (hepa) filtered vacuum cleaners are recommended by the u.s. department of housing and urban development for cleaning lead-contaminated house dust. we performed a randomized field study to determine whether a conventional (non-hepa) vacuum cleaner could achieve cleaning results comparable with those of a hepa vacuum cleaner. we compared the lead loading reductions of these two vacuum cleaners in a total of 127 new jersey homes of lead-exposed children. we used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. the vacuum sampling data showed that the hepa and non-hepa vacuum cleaners resulted in 54.7% (p = 0.006) and 36.4% (p = 0.020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two vacuum cleaners was not statistically significant (p = 0.293). the wipe sampling data did not show any significant lead loading reduction for either of the vacuum cleaners, suggesting that both vacuum cleaners fail to clean the surfaces of carpet effectively, considering that wipe sampling media simulate surface contact. on upholstery, the wipe sampling data showed a significant reduction in lead loading for the non-hepa vacuum cleaner (22.2%, p = 0.047). even with the significant reduction, the postcleaning lead loadings on upholstery were similar to those on carpets. the similar lead loading results for carpets and upholstery indicate that soiled upholstery may be as important a source of childhood lead exposure as carpets.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,structure,residential,indoor
the effect of interior lead hazard controls on children's blood lead concentrations: a systematic evaluation,"dust control is often recommended to prevent children's exposure to residential lead hazards, but the effect of these controls on children's blood lead concentrations is uncertain. we conducted a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials of low-cost, lead hazard control interventions to determine the effect of lead hazard control on children's blood lead concentration. four trials met the inclusion criteria. we examined mean blood lead concentration and elevated blood lead concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 mug/dl, greater than or equal to 15 mug/dl, and greater than or equal to 20 mug/dl) and found no significant differences in mean change in blood lead concentration for children by random group assignment (children assigned to the intervention group compared with those assigned to the control group). we found no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the percentage of children with blood lead greater than or equal to 10 mug/dl, 29% versus 32% [odds ratio (or), 0.85; 95 % confidence interval (ci), 0.56-1.3], but there was a significant difference in the percentage of children with blood lead greater than or equal to 15 mug/dl between the intervention and control groups, 6% versus 14% (or, 0.40; 95% ci, 0.21-0.80) and in the percentage of children with blood lead greater than or equal to 20 mug/dl between the intervention and control groups, 2% versus 6% (or, 0.29; 95 % ci, 0.10-0.85). we conclude that although low-cost, interior lead hazard control was associated with 50 % or greater reduction in the proportion of children who had blood lead concentrations exceeding 15 mug/dl and greater than or equal to 20 mug/dl, there was no substantial effect on mean blood lead concentration.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
environmental lead exposure during early childhood,"objective: to determine the relative contribution of residential lead hazards to children's blood lead concentrations during early childhood. methods: we enrolled children 6 months of age and followed them until 24 months of age. blood and samples of dust, soil, water and paint were analyzed for lead at 6-month intervals, and interviews were conducted to estimate nutritional, behavioral, and demographic factors linked with lead exposure. results: of the 276 children enrolled, 249 (90%) were followed until 24 months of age. the geometric mean blood lead concentration of children at 6 months of age was 2.9 microg/dl (95% ci, 2.7-3.1). at 24 months of age, children's mean blood lead was 7.5 microg/dl; 82 (33%) had a blood lead level of > or = 10 microg/dl. in adjusted analyses, lead-contaminated floor dust, soil, and water contributed to children's lead intake throughout the first 2 years of life (p < .05). lead-contaminated dust from window troughs was a source of lead exposure, especially in the second year of life. dietary iron intake, but not calcium intake, was inversely associated with blood lead levels (p < .05). blood lead concentration was over 50% higher in black than in white children (p = .0001). conclusion: lead-contaminated house dust is the major source of lead intake during early childhood. black children remain at increased risk for higher blood lead concentration after adjusting for environmental lead exposures and dietary intake.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
dissolution of lead pellets in saliva: a source of lead exposure in children,"lead is a nonessential element, being a toxic metal that can adversely affect humans exposed to it, even at low levels of exposure. indeed, children have been especially susceptible to lead toxicity with numerous epidemiological studies reporting neurocognitive functions to be inversely correlated with lead levels (blood or tooth-lead levels), even when confounding variables were controlled. further, evidence is accumulating supporting the suggestion that there may be no threshold to the detrimental effects of lead. thus, exposure to sources of lead should be kept to a minimum, especially for children (united states centers for disease control [uscdc] 1991; bellinger 1997). in the past, lead was ubiquitous in the environment; however, over the last three decades a concerted effort has been made to decrease or eliminate sources of environmental lead. in north america, the virtual elimination of unleaded gasoline, the use of lead-free solder in the canning industry and mechanical trades, and the decrease in lead content of new paint have all contributed to the decrease in environmental lead. although the uscdc has identified paint with a high lead content used in housing units prior to 1950, as the major source (reservoir) of lead for children (uscdc 1991), other sources of lead exposure must be considered. in the western james bay region of northern ontario (mushkegowuk territory), canada, elevated lead levels have been reported for adults (tsuji et al. 1997), children (ontario ministries of health and the environment [omhe] 1989; ontario ministry of health [omh] 1993), and newborns (hanning et al. 1997). these findings were surprising because the mushkegowuk territory is a remote area, where water and soil-lead levels have been found to be very low, and air-lead levels well under the established safety guidelines (omhe 1989). the source of lead exposure in this region appears to be related to the use of leaded ammunition in the harvesting of wild game (tsuji and nieboer 1997). several studies have shown that any animal harvested with leaded ammunition risks being contaminated with lead pellets and/or fragments, to the extent where the meat was not fit for human consumption (scheuhammer et al. 1998; tsuji et al. 1999). further, two recent studies in northern quebec, canada, have found supporting evidence for the hypothesis relating elevated lead levels in humans to the use of leaded ammunition in the harvesting of wild game. sex-adjusted data for first nation cree revealed elevation in blood-lead levels, compared to baseline data, two months after the goose harvest (kosatsky 1998). moreover, in a study by levesque et al. (1998) leaded ammunition was reported as the source of lead for inuit newborns, as determined by the stable isotope ratio technique. even though these studies are suggestive that the use of leaded ammunition is a significant source of lead exposure, other sources of lead exposure must be considered. considering other sources of lead exposure for children of the mushkegowuk territory is important, because observations and discussions with first nation children and their parents revealed that it is common practice to place lead pellets in the mouth as a place of temporary storage prior to discharge in air-pellet guns. we hypothesized that dissolution of pellets in saliva could be a significant source of lead exposure. boxes of copperhead® pellets (abrand commonly used in this region) have the following warning clearly displayed: """"warning: lead pellets. do not inhale pellet dust or put pellets in mouth. wash hands after handling. lead is a toxic substance listed under ca. prop 65 as causing reproductive toxicity."""" a literature search revealed several articles concerning the risk of lead poisoning from the accidental (greensher et al. 1974) or intentional (hitchings and sloan 1914) swallowing of lead pellets, but none regarding oral exposure through the above-mentioned practice. in this paper, we measured the degree of lead dissolution in saliva samples obtained from children in the james bay area, as well as the prevalence of the behaviour of storing lead pellets in the mouth, prior to discharge in air-pellet guns.[publication abstract]",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
blood lead concentrations and iron deficiency in canadian aboriginal infants,"aboriginal cree infants living in northern quebec who were 9 months of age were screened for anemia, iron deficiency and elevated blood lead concentrations. of the 314 infants who were eligible to participate, 274 (87.3%) were screened for anemia, 186 had blood lead concentration measured and 141 of the latter group had iron status determined. the median blood lead concentration was 0.08 micromol/l (range 0.01-1.00 micromol/l). the 25, 50 and 75 percentiles for blood lead concentration were 0.05, 0.08 and 0.12 micromol/l, respectively. the prevalence of elevated blood lead concentrations (> 0.48 micromol/l) was 2.7% (95% cl 0.36-5.0). among infants who had blood lead measured, the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/l) was 25.0% and 7.9% of infants had iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/l and serum ferritin < 10 microg/l). anemic infants had a higher mean geometric blood lead concentration than did babies without anemia (0.11 micromol/l vs. 0.07 micromol/l, p = 0.003). likewise, infants with iron-deficiency anemia had a significantly higher mean geometric blood lead concentration than infants without iron deficiency anemia (0.16 micromol/l vs. 0.07 micromol/l, p = 0.001). there was a significant negative correlation between blood lead and hemoglobin concentrations (r = -0.203, p = 0.006) and between blood lead and serum ferritin concentrations (r = -0.245, p = 0.003). infants who were fed traditional food (fish, fowl and game) did not have a significantly different mean geometric blood lead concentration, hemoglobin concentration or serum ferritin concentration than infants who did not eat traditional food. few infants (5.3%) ate traditional food daily.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
"a comparison of household lead exposure assessment methods in an old, urban community","the accurate assessment of lead hazards within the household is critical to the prevention of lead exposure to children living in urban communities. although dust wipes are currently accepted as the best method of assessing lead hazards, questionnaires and visual inspections are also used. this study evaluates the level of agreement among these three methods of assessment using a sample of 126 women living in old, urban houses. the level of agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic, which adjusts for chance agreement. overall, the kappa results for both the participant's assessment (questionnaire) and the visual inspector's assessment were low, indicating only slight to moderate agreement with the dust lead wipe levels. kappas were higher and more consistent for the visual inspector's assessment than for the participant's assessment. these results indicate that visual inspections and participant questionnaires may provide less accurate information regarding lead hazards within the household than dust wipes. because lead hazard recognition is important in the prevention of lead exposure in children, our data suggest that emphasis should be placed on the measurement of dust lead levels directly in assessing household lead hazards, possibly by teaching women in high-risk neighborhoods to take dust samples themselves.

identifying and managing adverse environmental health effects: 3. lead exposure,"lead levels in north american children and adults have declined in the past 3 decades, but lead persists in the environment in lead paint, old plumbing and contaminated soil. there are also a number of occupations and hobbies that carry a high risk of lead exposure. there is no evidence for a threshold below which lead has no adverse health effects. blood lead levels previously considered safe are now known to cause subtle, chronic health effects. the health effects of lead exposure include developmental neurotoxicity, reproductive dysfunction and toxicity to the kidneys, blood and endocrine systems. most lead exposures are preventable, and diagnosing lead poisoning is relatively simple compared with diagnosing health effects of exposures to other environmental toxins. accurate assessment of lead poisoning requires specific knowledge of the sources, high-risk groups and relevant laboratory tests. in this article we review the multiple, systemic toxic effects of lead and provide current information on groups at risk, prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment. we illustrate how the ch2opd2 mnemonic (community, home, hobbies, occupation, personal habits, diet and drugs) and specific screening questions are useful tools for physicians to quickly obtain an environmental exposure history and identify patients at high risk of lead exposure. by applying effective primary prevention, case-finding and treatment interventions for lead exposure, both the individual patient and the larger community reap the benefits of better health.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
a comparative study of manganese and lead levels in human umbilical cords and maternal blood from two urban centers exposed to different gasoline additives,"manganese (mn) and lead (pb) are two neurotoxic chemicals and experimental evidence suggests that they can cross the placental barrier. tetraethyl lead was still in use as an antiknock agent in paris during the sampling period of the study, while it has been replaced by methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (mmt) in canada since 1977. by 1990, mmt was in 100% of gasoline in canada. in a study of 160 pairs of mothers-neonates in montreal and 206 pairs in paris, we compared levels of mn and pb in the umbilical cord and in maternal blood. neonates and mothers had significantly higher pb levels in paris where lead additives were still used in gasoline. geometric mean maternal blood pb levels were 5.4 microg/dl compared to 2.1 microg/dl in montreal and cord blood pb levels were 3.2 microg/dl in parisian mothers compared to 1.7 microg/dl in montreal. the prevalence of paris pb values superior to the 95th percentile of the montreal distribution was highly elevated in all media studied. the prevalence of high mn levels in umbilical cord blood was also significantly higher in montreal. surveillance programs are important to limit pb overexposure and associated neurological effects in neonates where tetraethyl pb is still in use as a gasoline additive. since mn is an essential element and dietary mn intake may differ between montreal and paris, the difference observed with regard to high mn values between montreal and paris cannot, at this time, be attributed to mmt in montreal's gasoline. further studies are needed to infer an association between mn emissions from mmt and prenatal exposure to mn.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada and France,,,

adult : child differences in the intraspecies uncertainty factor: a case study using lead,"adults and children differ in their susceptibility to the toxic effects of lead. lead was therefore used as a case study to evaluate intraspecies differences by comparing the adult and child minimal lowest observed adverse effect level (loael) or the no observed adverse effect level (noael), allowing an evaluation of the ten-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor (uf). the lead intakes (in mug/kg/d) necessary to achieve target blood lead (pbb) levels reflecting the minimal loael or noael were determined using biokinetic slope factors (bksfs), which relate lead uptake to pbb levels. the analyses assumed chronic, low-level oral exposure to lead, and the response of a typical adult and child. child analyses used a target geometric mean (gm) pbb of 4.6 mug/dl (95% of population < 10 mu g/dl), resulting in lead intakes of 1.9 mu g/kg/day (assuming 100% soluble lead) and 4.9 mu g/kg/day (assuming 25% soluble lead and 75% soil lead). adult analyses assumed intake of 100% soluble lead, and used target gm pbb levels of 4.2 mu g/dl (95% of population < 11.1 mug/dl) and 11.4 mug/dl (95% of population <30 mu g/dl), resulting in lead intakes of 1.9 mu g/kg/ day and 5.1 mu g/kg/day, respectively. the results indicate that despite the greater vulnerability of young children to the effects of lead as compared to adults, the minimal loael or noael for lead is remarkably similar between children and adults. in this case, the application of a tenfold intraspecies uncertainty factor to adjust the adult minimal loael or noael for a child would be unnecessary, despite the well-established vulnerability of children to lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
economic gains resulting from the reduction in children's exposure to lead in the united states,"in this study we quantify economic benefits from projected improvements in worker productivity resulting from the reduction in children's exposure to lead in the united states since 1976. we calculated the decline in blood lead levels (blls) from 1976 to 1999 on the basis of nationally representative national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) data collected timing 1976 through 1980, 1991 through 1994, and 1999. the decline in mean bll in 1- to 5-year-old u.s. children from 1976-1980 to 1991-1994 was 12.3 mug/dl, and the estimated decline from 1976 to 1999 was 15.1 mug/dl. we assumed the change in cognitive ability resulting from declines in blls, on the basis of published meta-analyses, to be between 0.185 and 0.323 iq points for each 1 mug/dl blood lead concentration. these calculations imply that, because of falling blls, u.s. preschool-aged children in the late 1990s had iqs that were, on average, 2.2-4.7 points higher than they would have been if they had the blood lead distribution observed among u.s. preschool-aged children in the late 1970s. we estimated that each iq point raises worker productivity 1.76-2.38%. with discounted lifetime earnings of $723,300 for each 2-year-old in 2000 dollars, the estimated economic benefit for each year's cohort of 3.8 million 2-year-old children ranges from $110 billion to $319 billion.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead in candle emissions,"the candle-using public should be made aware that the core of candle wicks may contain lead. used as a stiffening agent to keep the wick out of the molten wax, lead can be emitted as particulates to the air and then deposited on indoor surfaces. to define the problem, 100 sets of candles (two or more identical candles) were purchased locally. the criterion for purchase was that the candles must appear to contain a metal-cored wick or be covered by a metallic pigment. of the candles purchased, 8% contained lead wicks. the wicks were 39-74% lead (the remainder was fabric or paper) and the lead cores (approx. 100% lead) had linear densities of 13-27 mg/cm. candles were burned to completion in a closed chamber to capture the air emissions, and the candle residue was extracted to assess the lead mass balance. it was found that individual candles emitted lead to the air at average rates that ranged from 100 to 1700 mug/h. assuming realistic indoor conditions, these emission rates were modeled to project room air concentration, child exposure by inhalation, and indoor deposition. results showed that burning single candles can easily raise the source room concentration above the ambient air lead concentration limit of 1.5 mug/m(3) set by epa. burning multiple candles can elevate it above osha permissible exposure limits of 50 mug/m(3). although blood lead levels have dropped precipitously in the united states since lead was phased out of gasoline in 1986, nearly 900 000 children still had levels above 10 mug/dl during nhanes iii. considering that candle sales in the us are estimated at $1-2 billion per year, and that children may spend as much as 88% of their time indoors, it is reasonable to suspect that some blood lead elevation in children arises from indoor micro-environments where lead-wick candles are burned.

the prevalence of lead-based paint hazards in us housing,"in this study we estimated the number of housing units in the united states with lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards. we included measurements of lead in intact and deteriorated paint, interior dust, and bare soil. a nationally representative, random sample of 831 housing units was evaluated in a survey between 1998 and 2000; the units and their occupants did not differ significantly from nationwide characteristics. results indicate that 38 million housing units had lead-based paint, down from the 1990 estimate of 64 million. twenty-four million had significant lead-based paint hazards. of those with hazards, 1.2 million units housed low-income families (< $30,000/year) with children under 6 years of age. although 17% of government-supported, low-income housing had hazards, 35% of all low-income housing had hazards. for households with incomes greater than or equal to $30,000/year, 19% had hazards. fourteen percent of all houses had significantly deteriorated lead-based paint, and 16% and 7%, respectively, had dust lead and soil lead levels above current standards of the u.s. department of housing and urban development and the u.s. environmental protection agency. the prevalence of lead-based paint and hazards increases with age of housing, but most painted surfaces, even in older housing, do not have lead-based paint. between 2% and 25% of painted building components were coated with lead-based paint. housing in the northeast and midwest had about twice the prevalence of hazards compared with housing in the south and west. the greatest risk occurs in older units with lead-based paint hazards that either will be or are currently occupied by families with children under 6 years of age and are low-income and/or are undergoing renovation or maintenance that disturbs lead-based paint. this study also confirms projections made in 2000 by the president's task force on environmental health risks and safety risks to children of the number of houses with lead-based paint hazards. public- and private-sector resources should be directed to units posing the greatest risk if future lead poisoning is to be prevented.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Northeast and midwest mentioned,,,
costs and benefits of enforcing housing policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning,"background. lead poisoning remains an important, yet entirely preventable disease among young children. this article compares the costs and benefits of strict versus limited enforcement of lead poisoning prevention housing policies in preventing additional cases of childhood blood lead elevation. methods. the author conducted decision analysis using population-based data that compared recurrence of childhood lead exposure in 2 urban areas with different enforcement capacity, and cost data from a federal project and from medical and public health literature. results. strict enforcement prevented additional cases, resulting in $45,360 savings from decreased medical and education costs and increased productivity for protected children. the model was robust to changing estimates of followup, housing repairs, re-location, and increases in lead levels over baseline. no cost savings were realized by strict enforcement if the probability of recurrence in limited units was 44% lower than estimated, or if fewer children were identified in limited versus strict enforcement units. if the discount rate for future productivity losses was greater than or equal to7.5%, strict enforcement did not lower costs. conclusion. this analysis suggests that strict enforcement of housing policies to prevent childhood blood lead elevation results in decreased societal costs due to the avoidance of future medical and special education and to increased productivity of resident children.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
assessment of cleaning to control lead dust in homes of children with moderate lead poisoning: treatment of lead-exposed children trial,"in this article we describe the assessment and control of lead dust exposure in the treatment of lead-exposed children (tlc) trial, a clinical trial of the effects of oral chelation on developmental end points in urban children with moderately elevated blood lead levels. to reduce potential lead exposure from settled dust or deteriorated paint during the drug treatment phase of the trial, the homes of 765 (98%) of the randomized children (both active and placebo drug treatment groups) were professionally cleaned. lead dust measurements were made in a sample of 213 homes before and after cleaning. geometric mean dust lead loadings before cleaning were 43, 29, 308, and 707 micro g/ft2 in the kitchen floor, playroom floor, playroom windowsill, and playroom window well samples respectively. following cleaning, floor dust lead loadings were reduced on average 32% for paired floor samples (p < 0.0001), 66% for windowsills (p < 0.0001), and 93% for window wells (p < 0.0001). cleaning was most effective for 146 homes with precleaning dust lead levels above the recommended clearance levels, with average reductions of 44%, 74%, and 93% for floors (p < 0.0001), windowsills (p < 0.0001), and window wells (p < 0.0001), respectively. despite these substantial reductions in dust lead loadings, a single professional cleaning did not reduce the lead loadings of all dust samples to levels below current federal standards for lead in residential dust. attainment of dust levels below current standards will require more intensive cleaning and lead hazard reduction strategies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
influence of nutrient intake on blood lead levels of young children at risk for lead poisoning,"although removal of lead paint hazards from at-risk houses remains the primary means of preventing elevated blood lead among young children, reduction of risk through nutritional factors has also been of interest. in this study we evaluated the effect of nutrient intake on blood lead levels by analyzing whether the intakes of certain dietary components a) were associated with blood lead levels independent of lead exposure or b) modified the effect of lead exposure on blood lead. subjects were 205 children from low-income families who were approximately i year of age and living in old, urban houses. the data collected for each child included blood lead level, nutritional status, and amount of lead exposure, which was assessed from samples of household dust. multiple linear regression analyses showed a statistically significant positive association between lead exposure and blood lead. statistically significant positive associations were found between blood lead and total fat as well as blood lead and saturated fat, independent of lead exposure and age of the child. regression modeling and stratified analysis showed that mean blood lead increased with increasing lead exposure as well as with increasing caloric intake, suggesting that caloric intake modifies the association between lead exposure and blood lead. the findings from this study, if replicated in other studies, support a dietary intervention to reduce the amount of total calories, total fat, and saturated fat among children 1 year of age at risk for lead exposure, while maintaining adequate intake of these dietary components. our results also reinforce recommendations that removal of lead paint hazards from at-risk houses should be the primary means of preventing lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

is home renovation or repair a risk factor for exposure to lead among children residing in new york city?,"children can be lead poisoned when leaded paint is disturbed during home renovation or repair. we conducted a case-control study to assess the association between elevated blood lead levels (blls) in children younger than 5 years of age and renovation or repair of homes built before 1950 in new york city. in 1998, we interviewed parents of 106 case children (blls >/= 10 micro g/dl) and 159 control children (blls </= 5 micro g/dl) living in selected new york city neighborhoods. we then used logistic regression methods to estimate odds ratios (ors) for elevated blls among children living in housing that had undergone various renovations or repairs in the 6 months before the blood lead test, and we adjusted for age and test month. case children were only slightly more likely than control children to live in a house that had undergone any renovation (or = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [95% ci] = 0.7, 2.1). case children were more likely to (1) live in housing that had interior surfaces prepared for painting, especially by hand sanding (or = 3.5, 95% ci = 1.1, 10.9; population attributable risk [par%] = 10.4%, 95% ci = 0.5%, 19.3%); and (2) have work-created dust throughout their housing unit (or = 6.3, 95% ci = 1.2, 32.3; par% = 6.8%, 95% ci = 0.0%, 13.1%). the risk for excess lead exposure is increased by home renovation or repair work involving interior paint preparation or reported dispersal of dust beyond the work area. the proportion of cases related to this exposure is high enough to merit preventive measures.",nongeographical,new york,0,New York City,structure,residential,indoor
childhood lead poisoning from paint chips: a continuing problem,"although lead poisoning (plumbism) has been recognized for centuries, lead exposures still occur frequently today because of its varied uses and persistence in the environment. despite the awareness of the adverse effects of lead on adults, childhood plumbism was first reported only about a century ago. young children are one of the most vulnerable groups to the adverse effects of lead because of their rapidly developing central nervous systems. federal regulations in the 1970s have been successfully implemented to decrease the amount of environmental lead by decreasing the content of lead in gasoline and indoor paint. however, almost 30 years after these laws were passed, inner-city housing with leaded paint still exists. we describe three children living in new york city who developed plumbism from the ingestion of leaded paint chips.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

evaluation of a childhood lead questionnaire in predicting elevated blood lead levels in a rural community,"the accuracy of a lead screening questionnaire in predicting elevated blood lead levels was examined in a pediatric practice in a rural part of new york state. a retrospective chart review was used to collect data on children ages 9 to 24 months who presented for well-child visits. children with both questionnaire and lead level results available in the chart were included in the study (n = 171). the mean blood lead level among all children was 1.6 microg/dl (median = 2.0 microg/dl, range 0 to 24 microg/dl). four children (2.3%) had elevated lead levels (greater than 10 microg/dl), with levels for two of these children being greater than 20 microg/dl. although our lead screening questionnaire was expanded from the standard 1991 cdc questionnaire by the inclusion of six additional items, it was not especially useful in predicting elevated blood lead levels above 10 microg/dl. however, the questionnaire exhibited some utility in predicting marked elevations in blood lead levels (over 20 microg/dl). although results in other geographic areas might differ, the lead questionnaire may have value by enhancing parents' awareness of potential lead hazards in their children's environment and may prove to be more useful in areas of high risk to lead exposure.",new york,new york,1,,screening,screening,NA
risks to children from exposure to lead in air during remedial or removal activities at superfund sites: a case study of the rsr lead smelter superfund site,"superfund sites that are contaminated with lead and undergoing remedial action generate lead-enriched dust that can be released into the air. activities that can emit lead-enriched dust include demolition of lead smelter buildings, stacks, and baghouses; on-site traffic of heavy construction vehicles; and excavation of soil. typically, air monitoring stations are placed around the perimeter of a site of an ongoing remediation to monitor air lead concentrations that might result from site emissions. the national ambient air quality (naaq) standard, established in 1978 to be a quarterly average of 1.5 microg/m(3), is often used as a trigger level for corrective action to reduce emissions. this study explored modeling approaches for assessing potential risks to children from air lead emissions from the rsr superfund site in west dallas, tx, during demolition and removal of a smelter facility. the epa integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model and the international commission of radiologic protection (icrp) lead model were used to simulate blood lead concentrations in children, based on monitored air lead concentrations. although air lead concentrations at monitoring stations located in the downwind community intermittently exceeded the naaq standard, both models indicated that exposures to children in the community areas did not pose a significant long-term or acute risk. long-term risk was defined as greater than 5% probability of a child having a long-term blood lead concentration that exceeded 10 microg/dl, which is the cdc and the epa blood lead concern level. short-term or acute risk was defined as greater than 5% probability of a child having a blood lead concentration on any given day that exceeded 20 microg/dl, which is the cdc trigger level for medical evaluation (this is not intended to imply that 20 microg/dl is a threshold for health effects in children exposed acutely to airborne lead). the estimated potential long-term and short-term exposures at the downwind west dallas community did not result in more than 5% of children exceeding the target blood lead levels. the models were also used to estimate air lead levels for short-term and long-term exposures that would not exceed specified levels of risk (risk-based concentrations, rbcs). rbcs were derived for various daily exposure durations (3 or 8 h/day) and frequencies (1-7 days/week). rbcs based on the icrp model ranged from 0.3 (7 days/week, 8 h/day) to 4.4 microg/m(3) (1 day/week, 3 h/day) for long-term exposures and were lower than those based on the ieubk model. for short-term exposures, the rbcs ranged from 3.5 to 29.0 microg/m(3). recontamination of remediated residential yards from deposition of air lead emitted during remedial activities at the rsr superfund site was also examined. the predicted increase in soil concentration due to lead deposition at the monitoring station, which represented the community at large, was 3.0 mg/kg. this potential increase in soil lead concentration was insignificant, less than 1% increase, when compared to the clean-up level of 500 mg/kg developed for residential yards at the site.",texas,texas,1,,environment,risk assessment,outdoor
"maternal blood lead concentration, diet during pregnancy, and anthropometry predict neonatal blood lead in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population","to determine the influences of maternal diet and nutrition during pregnancy on the blood lead level of neonates, we conducted a study of mother-infant pairs from lower socioeconomic circumstances living in albany county, new york. maternal blood lead (mbpb), anthropometry, and diet were assessed in each trimester. neonates' blood lead (nbpb) levels were low (geometric mean = 1.58 micro g/dl), and none had elevated blood lead. more than 50% of the mothers had intakes below the recommended dietary allowances for zinc, calcium, iron, vitamin d, and kilocalories. as expected, mbpb was strongly and positively related to nbpb. among the anthropometric measures of maternal nutritional status, variables measuring gain in weight and arm circumference were negatively related to nbpb. in multivariable models reflecting different analytic strageties and including mbpb, anthropometry, and sociodemographic characteristics, dietary intakes of iron and vitamin d were negatively related to nbpb. the effect of zinc varied substantially depending on model covariates. effects of dietary constituents are difficult to distinguish, given the intercorrelated nature of nutrients in the diet. nevertheless, the influences of maternal anthropometric variables, iron, and vitamin d on neonatal lead levels are clear in our analyses.",new york,new york,1,,maternity,prenatal,NA
assessing remedial effectiveness through the blood lead:soil/dust lead relationship at the bunker hill superfund site in the silver valley of idaho,"the 21 square mile bunker hill superfund site in northern idaho includes several thousand acres of contaminated hillsides and floodplain, a 365-acre abandoned lead/zinc smelter and is home to more than 7000 people in 5 residential communities. childhood lead poisoning was epidemic in the 1970s with >75% of children exceeding 40 microg/dl blood lead. health response activities have been ongoing for three decades. in 1991, a blood lead goal of 95% of children with levels less than 10 microg/dl was adopted. the cleanup strategy, based on biokinetic pathways models, was to reduce house dust lead exposure through elimination of soil-borne sources. an interim health intervention program, that included monitoring blood lead and exposures levels, was instituted to reduce exposures through parental education during the cleanup. in 1989 and 2001, 56% and 3% of children, respectively, exceeded the blood lead criteria. more than 4000 paired blood lead/environmental exposure observations were collected during this period. several analyses of these data were accomplished. slope factors derived for the relationship between blood lead, soil and dust concentrations are age-dependent and similar to literature reported values. repeat measures analysis assessing year to year changes found that the remediation effort (without intervention) had approximately a 7.5 microg/dl effect in reducing a 2-year-old child's mean blood lead level over the course of the last ten years. those receiving intervention had an additional 2-15 microg/dl decrease. structural equations models indicate that from 40 to 50% of the blood lead absorbed from soils and dusts is through house dust with approximately 30% directly from community-wide soils and 30% from the home yard and immediate neighborhood. both mean blood lead levels and percent of children to exceed 10 microg/dl have paralleled soil/dust lead intake rates estimated from the pathways model. application of the ieubk model for lead indicates that recommended usepa default parameters overestimate mean blood lead levels, although the magnitude of over-prediction is diminished in recent years. application of the site-specific model, using the soil and dust partitions suggested in the pathways model and an effective bioavailability of 18%, accurately predicts mean blood lead levels and percent of children to exceed 10 microg/dl throughout the 11-year cleanup period. this reduced response rate application of the ieubk is consistent with the analysis used to originally develop the cleanup criteria and indicates the blood lead goal will be achieved.",idaho,idaho,1,,environment,risk assessment,both

using geographic information systems to assess risk for elevated blood lead levels in children,"objectives. targeted screening for childhood lead poisoning depends on assessment of risk factors including housing age. using a geographic information system (gis), we aim to determine high-risk regions in charleston county, south carolina, to assist public health officials in developing targeted leadscreening. methods. properties built before 1978 were geocoded (assigned latitude and longitude coordinates) from tax assessor data. addresses of charleston county children who have been screened for lead poisoning were also geocoded. locations of all housing, lead poisoning cases, and negative screens were created as separate map layers. prevalence ratios of lead poisoning cases were calculated, as were relative risks for each category of housing. results. maps of charleston county were produced showing the location of old housing, where screening took place, and where cases were found. one thousand forty-four cases were identified. twenty percent of children living in pre-1950 homes had elevated blood lead levels (ebll). children living in pre-1950 housing were 3.9 times more likely to have an ebll than children living in post-1977 housing. there was no difference in risk of living in a 1950-1977 home vs. a post-1977 home. a large number of cases were also found in an area of newer houses, but near a potential point source. eighty-two percent of all screens were from children in post-1977 homes. conclusions. children living in pre-1950 housing were at higher risk for lead poisoning. gis is useful in identifying areas of risk and unexpected clustering from potential point sources and may be useful for public health officials in developing targeted screening programs.",south carolina,south carolina,1,,exploratory,sociodemographic,NA

impact of home carpets on childhood lead intervention study,"blood lead data for a childhood lead exposure study have been reanalyzed to examine the impact of carpets on the effectiveness of a cleaning intervention in 39 new jersey urban houses. all eligible houses in the study were classified as carpeted and uncarpeted depending on the number of rooms that were carpeted. the cleaning protocol was associated with a significant reduction in the blood lead concentrations for the uncarpeted homes (p = 0.004), whereas no significant change was found for the carpeted homes (p = 0.566). we also completed correlation analyses between the number of cleaning visits and the percentage reduction in blood lead for the carpeted/uncarpeted houses. there was a significant correlation (r = 0.67) between the number of cleanings and blood lead reduction for the uncarpeted homes, but no correlation (r = 0.04) for the carpeted homes. in a multiple regression model that took confounding variables into account, the carpet status (carpeted or uncarpeted) remained a factor of the effect of cleaning on blood lead (p = 0.05). we conclude that the presence of contaminated carpets inhibits the effectiveness of home cleaning despite a high-efficiency particulate air filtered vacuum protocol that removes a substantial amount of lead dust.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,structure,residential,indoor

effect of smelter emission reductions on children's blood lead levels,"trail, british columbia has been the site of an active lead-zinc smelter for approximately 95 years. since 1989, the community has been monitoring blood lead levels in children, studying exposure pathways and conducting comprehensive education and case management programs. from 1989 through 1996, mean blood lead levels of pre-school children declined at an average rate of 0.6 microg/dl per year. from 1996 to 1999, mean blood lead levels fell at an average rate of 1.8 microg/dl per year, from 11.5 in 1996 to 5.9 in 1999. the recent rapid decline appears to be mainly attributable to the start-up of a new lead smelter using modern flash-smelting technology in may of 1997. in 1998, the annual arithmetic mean air lead level in trail was 0.28 microg/m(3), compared with 1.1 microg/m(3) in 1996. reductions of approximately 50% were observed in lead loadings and concentrations in outdoor dustfall, street dust and indoor dustfall after smelter emissions were reduced. slight reductions (statistically insignificant) have been observed in carpet dust and soil lead concentrations. during the summer of 2001, the smelting and refining operations at trail were shut down completely for 3 months. during this period, average air lead levels in trail dropped to 0.03 microg/m(3). the average blood lead level in trail pre-school children at the end of the shutdown was 4.7 microg/dl. these results challenge prevailing theories about the relative importance of various environmental lead sources. for example, the us epa integrated biokinetic uptake model for lead (ieubk), with its emphasis on soil concentrations, would not have predicted the dramatic decline in children's blood lead levels seen in trail following the reductions in air lead levels. the trail experience suggests that increased attention should be paid to the importance of active sources of highly bioavailable and mobile lead bearing dusts.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

a case study of lead contamination cleanup effectiveness at bunker hill,"a review of cleanup effectiveness at bunker hill superfund site (bhss) has shown that yard soil cleanup is an effective tool for reducing house dust lead concentrations, thereby reducing children's blood lead levels. this review has also shown that contiguous cleanup of residences has a three-fold greater reduction of children's blood lead levels compared with cleaning only those homes where children currently reside by reducing exposures attributable to neighboring properties. this review underscores the importance of a community-wide, preventative approach to controlling lead contamination in soil and house dust. this review has further characterized the need for careful design, implementation, and perpetual maintenance of a community-wide lead cleanup. several key areas of importance to maintain large scale mining/smelting remedies in the bunker hill area were analyzed and noted for further action, including: infrastructure, institutional controls for homeowner projects (post cleanup), erosion control for undeveloped hillsides with potential to impact the developed valley floor, drainage improvements and flood control, waste piles, and increasing the rate at which cleanup proceeds. focusing on these areas is crucial to minimizing recontamination at a large scale lead cleanup.

the effect of soil abatement on blood lead levels in children living near a former smelting and milling operation,"objective: to evaluate the effect of soil abatement on children's blood lead concentrations and on environmental levels of lead and arsenic. methods: two cross-sectional surveys were conducted. the first (1989) was of a random sample of 6- to 72-month-old children (n=112). the second (1998) included all 6- to 72-month-old children whose parents agreed to participate in the survey (n=215). from 1993 to 1996, soil abatement was conducted around homes with average soil lead concentration >500 parts per million (ppm). venipuncture blood samples were taken, interviews were conducted, and samples of house dust, soil, water, and paint were tested for lead and arsenic, using identical protocols in both surveys. the expected decline in blood lead concentrations were calculated for children who lived in houses that were abated, compared with children who lived in houses that were not abated. results: lead and arsenic in soil and interior dust in homes that underwent soil abatement declined significantly compared to unabated homes (p<.05). after adjustment for potential confounders, the blood lead concentration in children ages 6 to 72 months who lived in soil-abated housing declined 42.8% faster than children who lived in unabated housing (p=0.14). in children ages 6 to 36 months, the decline was 45.4% faster (p=0.03). the estimated reduction in blood lead for children ages 6 to 36 months was 3.5 micro g/dl for every 1,000 ppm reduction in soil lead concentration (95% confidence interval [ci]=2.4 micro g/dl, 4.6 micro g/dl). conclusion: soil abatement was associated with a significant decline in children's blood lead and indoor environmental levels of lead and arsenic.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

hierarchical sampling of multiple strata: an innovative technique in exposure characterization,"sampling of multiple strata, or hierarchical sampling of various exposure sources and activity areas, has been tested and is suggested as a method to sample (or to locate) areas with a high prevalence of elevated blood lead in children. hierarchical sampling was devised to supplement traditional soil lead sampling of a single stratum, either residential or fixed point source, using a multistep strategy. blood lead (n = 1141) and soil lead (n = 378) data collected under the usepa/uci tijuana lead project (1996-1999) were analyzed to evaluate the usefulness of sampling soil lead from background sites, schools and parks, point sources, and residences. results revealed that industrial emissions have been a contributing factor to soil lead contamination in tijuana. at the regional level, point source soil lead was associated with mean blood lead levels and concurrent high background, and point source soil lead levels were predictive of a high percentage of subjects with blood lead equal to or greater than 10 mug/dl (pe 10). significant relationships were observed between mean blood lead level and fixed point source soil lead (r = 0.93; p<0.05; r-2 = 0.72 using a quadratic model) and between residential soil lead and fixed point source soil lead (r = 0.90; p<0.05; r-2 = 0.86 using a cubic model). this study suggests that point sources alone are not sufficient for predicting the relative risk of exposure to lead in the urban environment. these findings will be useful in defining regions for targeted or universal soil lead sampling by site type. point sources have been observed to be predictive of mean blood lead at the regional level; however, this relationship alone was not sufficient to predict pe 10. it is concluded that when apparently undisturbed sites reveal high soil lead levels in addition to local point sources, dispersion of lead is widespread and will be associated with a high prevalence of elevated blood lead in children. multiple strata sampling was shown to be useful in differentiating among sources by site-specific association to mean blood lead and the prevalence of elevated blood lead at the regional level.

the effect of lead-based paint hazard remediation on blood lead levels of lead poisoned children in new york city,"despite the widespread use of lead paint hazard control for children with lead poisoning, few controlled studies that estimate the effect of such control on children's blood lead levels have been published. this retrospective follow-up study examined the effects of lead hazard remediation and its timing on the blood lead levels of lead-poisoned children. from the new york city child blood lead registry, 221 children were selected who had an initial blood lead level of 20-44 micro g/dl between 1 july 1994 and 31 december 1996; were 6 months to 6 years of age; had a report of a follow-up blood lead test between 10 and 14 months after the initial test; had a lead-based paint hazard identified in the primary dwelling unit prior to the 10- to 14-month follow-up blood lead test; had resided or spent time at only one address with an identified lead-based paint hazard; and were not chelated. the decline in geometric mean blood lead levels from baseline to 10-14 months later was compared for children whose homes were remediated and whose homes were not remediated during the follow-up period. regardless of remediation, geometric mean blood lead levels declined significantly from 24.3 micro g/dl at the initial diagnosis to 12.3 micro g/dl at the 10- to 14-month follow-up blood lead test (p<0.01). among the 146 children whose homes were remediated the geometric mean blood lead levels declined 53% compared to 41% among the 75 children whose homes were not remediated by the follow-up blood lead test, a remediation effect of approximately 20% (p<0.01). after adjusting for potential confounders, the remediation effect was 11%, although it was no longer significant. race was the only factor that appeared to confound the relationship: black children had higher follow-up blood lead levels even after controlling for other factors, including the natural logarithm of the initial blood lead level. the effect of remediation appeared to be stronger for younger (10 to <36 months old) than for older (36 to 72 months old) children (p=0.06). while children in homes with earlier remediation (within less than 3 months) appeared to have greater declines in blood lead levels at the follow-up test than children in homes with later remediation (after 3 or more months), this trend was not significant when controlling for confounding factors. the findings of this study suggest that early identification of lead-poisoned children and timely investigation and abatement of hazards contribute to reducing blood lead levels. however, the apparent effect is modest and further research is needed to systematically test and improve the effectiveness of lead hazard controls.",nongeographical,new york,0,New York City,structure,abatement,indoor
influence of environmental zinc on the association between environmental and biological measures of lead in children,"exposure to lead, a common environmental contaminant found at hazardous waste sites, has been associated with adverse health effects to humans. zinc, a nutritionally essential metal, may influence both the absorption and the toxicity of lead. the purpose of this study was to determine if zinc levels present in the environment affect the association between environmental lead measured in two small communities in the northeastern united states and biological measurements of lead in the residents of these communities. soil and dust sampled in and around the homes of all participants were tested for lead and zinc. residents aged 6 months to 14 years (n=214) provided blood samples for the determination of blood lead concentrations. soil and dust measurements of environmental lead were positively associated with blood lead, regardless of the corresponding zinc levels in these samples. however, the magnitude of this association was 20% to 46% lower in areas with high environmental measures of zinc. the interactions between environmental lead and environmental zinc levels and blood lead concentrations suggest that zinc may influence the association between soil and dust lead and corresponding blood lead levels.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Northeast,,,

"environmental, dietary, demographic, and activity variables associated with biomarkers of exposure for benzene and lead","classification and regression tree methods represent a potentially powerful means of identifying patterns in exposure data that may otherwise be overlooked. here, regression tree models are developed to identify associations between blood concentrations of benzene and lead and over 300 variables of disparate type (numerical and categorical), often with observations that are missing or below the quantitation limit. benzene and lead are selected from among all the environmental agents measured in the nhexas region v study because they are ubiquitous, and they serve as paradigms for volatile organic compounds (vocs) and heavy metals, two classes of environmental agents that have very different properties. two sets of regression models were developed. in the first set, only environmental and dietary measurements were employed as predictor variables, while in the second set these were supplemented with demographic and time-activity data. in both sets of regression models, the predictor variables were regressed on the blood concentrations of the environmental agents. jack-knife cross-validation was employed to detect overfitting of the models to the data. blood concentrations of benzene were found to be associated with: (a) indoor air concentrations of benzene; (b) the duration of time spent indoors with someone who was smoking; and (c) the number of cigarettes smoked by the subject. all these associations suggest that tobacco smoke is a major source of exposure to benzene. blood concentrations of lead were found to be associated with: (a) house dust concentrations of lead; (b) the duration of time spent working in a closed workshop; and (c) the year in which the subject moved into the residence. an unexpected finding was that the regression trees identified time-activity data as better predictors of the blood concentrations than the measurements in environmental and dietary media.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

effectiveness of cleaning and health education in reducing childhood lead poisoning among children residing near superfund sites in missouri,"in this study, the authors evaluated whether a combination of tailored education, lead dust removal by trained cleaning specialists, and family follow-up visits would be more effective than conventional health educational programs in reducing elevated blood lead levels in children living in or near lead mining hazardous waste sites. the authors randomized children between 6 and 72 mo of age with blood lead levels between 10 and 20 microg/dl into 3 groups: standard care, tailored newsletters, or tailored newsletters and specialized cleaning. the authors obtained questionnaires, blood lead levels, and environmental lead samples during initiation and compared them with the same items obtained at 3, 6, and 9 mo follow-up. they used a linear mixed effect model to evaluate the intervention effect. blood lead levels decreased overall 1.54 microg/dl (12.1%) during the study. the authors found that tailored newsletters and specialized cleaning produced the greatest decline in blood lead levels, but no statistical differences were found among the methodologies. the small decline observed in blood lead levels reduced levels to below 10 microg/dl for 40% of the children.",missouri,missouri,1,,lead education,education,both
"blood lead levels in residents of homes with elevated lead in tap water--district of columbia, 2004","lead exposure adversely affects intellectual development in young children and might increase the risk for hypertension in adults. in the district of columbia (dc), of an estimated 130,000 residences, approximately 23,000 (18%) have lead service pipes (daniel lucey, md, dc department of health [dcdoh], personal communication, march 24, 2004). the environmental protection agency (epa) requires water authorities to test tap water in 10-100 residences annually for lead. in march 2003, dc water and sewer authority (wasa) expanded its lead-in-water testing program to homes with lead service pipes extending from the water main to the house. by late january 2004, results of the expanded water testing indicated that the majority of homes tested had water lead levels above epa's action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). on february 16, dcdoh requested cdc assistance to assess health effects of elevated lead levels in residential tap water. dcdoh also requested deployment of officers of the united states public health service (usphs) to assist in the investigations. this report summarizes the results of the preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated water lead levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (blls). the investigation of elevated water lead levels is ongoing. in the interim, dcdoh has recommended that young children and pregnant and breast-feeding women refrain from drinking unfiltered tap water.",district of columbia,district of columbia,1,,infrastructure,residential,indoor
change in blood lead concentration up to 1 year after a gunshot wound with a retained bullet,"the authors studied the time course and prevalence of elevated blood lead concentrations and associated injury- and patient-specific factors during the first year following gunshot injury. they determined blood lead levels at mean time points of 0.3, 3.1, 18.7, 94.5, 188.3, and 349.4 days after injury in a volunteer sample of 451 subjects from a los angeles, california, trauma center who sustained a first-time gunshot injury with a retained projectile in 2000-2002. in mixed-model analyses, blood lead levels increased with time postinjury (p < 0.0005) up to 3 months, with number of retained fragments (p < 0.0005), and with increasing age (p < 0.0005). increased blood lead concentration as a function of fragmentation was approximately 30% higher among subjects who had suffered bone fracture in the torso (p < 0.0005). subjects with bullets or fragments lodged near bone (p < 0.0005) or near joints (p = 0.032) had higher blood lead levels. logistic models correctly predicted a blood lead elevation of >/=20 micro g/dl in 81% and 85% of subjects at 3 and 6 months postinjury, respectively. the prevalence of elevated blood lead was 11.8% at 3 months and 2.6% at 12 months. the authors recommend continued surveillance of blood lead levels after gunshot injury for patients with key indicators.",california,california,1,,gun,ammunition,NA

can metal concentrations in indoor dust be predicted from soil geochemistry?,"due to the scarcity of metal concentration data for indoor environments, many studies rely on exterior soil geochemical data for predicting indoor exposures. this study demonstrates that existing predictive models do not hold for the city of ottawa, where there is a lack of spatial correlation between elemental concentrations in indoor dust and outdoor soil, indicating a high degree of variability of indoor/outdoor concentration ratios. """"total metal concentrations"""" are determined in house dust and soil samples using an aggressive combination acid digestion procedure and """"migratable metal concentrations"""" are determined using a simulated stomach acid digestion procedure. geometric mean indoor/outdoor ratios calculated using the total extraction method are: 5.5 for pb, 16.4 for cd, and 3.4 for ni (based on measurements in 48 ottawa houses). indoor/outdoor ratios calculated using the migratable extraction method are: 24.8 for pb, 20.7 for cd, and 40.4 for ni. organic matter content is elevated in house dust (20-34 %) compared to exterior soil (4%), and organic matter correlates positively with migratable concentrations of pb, cu and ni. it is concluded that the consistently higher total and migratable concentrations and relative bioavailability factors in house dust compared to soil is largely explained by the affinity of these metals for organic components of dust.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

an unexplained case of elevated blood lead in a hispanic child,"a 6-month-old child presented to a local pediatrician with an elevated blood lead level (bll) of 41 mug/dl. the child was treated as an outpatient for chelation therapy by a toxicologist. subsequent blls obtained at 8 and 13 months of age were 40 mug/dl and 42 mug/dl, respectively. siblings and family members had blls < 5 mug/dl except for the mother, who had a bll of 14 mug/dl when the child was 6 months of age. home inspections and phone calls to the family revealed no sources of lead from paint, dust, toys, mini-blinds, keys, food, water, or any take-home exposure. the family denied use of folk remedies such as greta and azarcon. the child was breast-fed, but the mother's bll was not sufficiently high to explain the elevated bll in the child. housekeeping was excellent. the mother did admit to cooking beans in mexican pottery (pieces found outside were positive for lead), but she discontinued use after the initial lead check at 6 months. the bean pot was not a likely source, as none of the family had elevated blls including a 5-year-old sister. follow-up testing of blood lead when the child was 15 months of age revealed values of 28 mug/dl for the child and 9 mug/dl for the mother. subsequent testing of the child shows a slow decline. the slow release of lead suggests depletion of bone stores acquired during pregnancy, possibly due to pica behavior of the mother during pregnancy.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead levels of edibles grown in contaminated residential soils: a field survey,"plants grown in lead contaminated soils can accumulate lead from the adherence of dust and translocation into the plant tissue. in order to evaluate the potential health hazard due to the consumption of plants grown in residential gardens contaminated by lead, a survey of the lead concentrations in a typical array of edible vegetables, fruits and herbs was conducted. samples of garden plants harvested from the field were washed with detergent or water alone to remove adhered soil. they were dried, separated into sections including root, shoot and edible fruit, and then analyzed for lead content using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (icp-aes). soil samples, taken in conjunction with the plant harvesting, were analyzed using flame atomic absorbance (faa). a pattern of lead transference from soil through the root to the stem and leaves of garden crops was found. the majority of the lead was concentrated in the roots (root:soil ranging from 0.02 to 0.51), with some translocation into the shoots (shoot:soil as high as 0.10). this pattern is a concern particularly for crops in which the root, stems, stalks or leaves are edible. the lead concentration in fruiting vegetables was less than the detection limit of 10 ppm (microgram lead/gram dry plant matter). some edible portions of the leafy vegetables and herbs, however, were found to have lead levels that, if consumed, could contribute to the total body burden of lead. therefore, urban gardeners should test the lead levels in their soils and develop strategies to ensure safety.

lead,"children differ from adults in the relative importance of lead sources and pathways, lead metabolism, and the toxicities expressed. the central nervous system effects of lead on children seem not to be reversible. periods of enhanced vulnerability within childhood have not consistently been identified. the period of greatest vulnerability might be endpoint specific, perhaps accounting for the failure to identify a coherent """"behavioral signature"""" for lead toxicity. the bases for the substantial individual variability in vulnerability to lead are uncertain, although they might include genetic polymorphisms and contextual factors. the current centers for disease control and prevention screening guideline of 10 mug/dl is a risk management tool and should not be interpreted as a threshold for toxicity. no threshold has been identified, and some data are consistent with effects well below 10. historically, most studies have concentrated on neurocognitive effects of lead, but higher exposures have recently been associated with morbidities such as antisocial behavior and delinquency. studies of lead toxicity in experimental animal models are critical to the interpretation of nonexperimental human studies, particularly in addressing the likelihood that associations observed in the latter studies can be attributed to residual confounding. animal models are also helpful in investigating the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of the functional deficits observed in lead-exposed humans. studies of adults who have been exposed to lead are of limited use in understanding childhood lead toxicity because developmental and acquired lead exposure differ in terms of the maturity of the organs affected, the presumed mechanisms of toxicity, and the forms in which toxicities are expressed.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

seasonality and trend in blood lead levels of new york state children,"background: environmental exposure to lead remains a significant health problem for children. the costs of lead exposure in children are estimated to be considerably more than other childhood diseases of environmental origin. while long-term trends in blood lead levels (blls) among children are declining, seasonal variation persists. cross-sectional studies have found a peak in summer months. part of this variation may be due to increased exposure to lead paint on window sills and through increased contact with soils containing lead during the summer. the current study represents the largest published population-based study on seasonality and trends in the blls of children to date. in addition, the results offer a comparison of recent data on seasonality of blls in new york state children, to studies conducted over the past three decades. methods: 262,687 new york state children born between 1994 and 1997 were screened for blood lead within 2 weeks of their first or second birthdays. time series analyses of blood lead data from these children were conducted to study the seasonality and trends of blls. results: children's blood lead values showed a distinct seasonal cycle on top of a long-term decreasing trend. the geometric mean bll declined by about 24% for children born between 1994 and 1997. the prevalence of elevated blls in two-year-olds was almost twice that in one-year-olds over the time period. nearly twice as many children had elevated blls in the late summer compared to late winter/early spring. in this and previous cross-sectional studies, the amount of seasonality as a proportion of the mean ranged between 15% and 30%. conclusion: pediatricians should be aware of the seasonality of blls. for example, if a two-year-old receives a borderline result during the winter, it is possible that the levels would have been higher if he had been tested during the summer. however, physicians should continue to screen children at their normally scheduled well-child visits rather than delaying until summertime and possibly postponing the discovery of an elevated bll. age, season, and time trends still need to be considered in lead studies and result interpretation.",nongeographical,new york,0,New YOrk State,seasonal,screening,

"a pilot study of the measurement and control of deep dust, surface dust, and lead in 10 old carpets using the 3-spot test while vacuuming","this pilot study measured and examined the relationship between surface dust, deep dust, lead (pb), and the 3-spot test during vacuuming of carpets. the 3-spot test measures the total time in seconds for the indicator light on a hoover vacuum with dirt detector (hvdd) to turn from red to green on three spots 3 feet apart at least 4 feet from an entrance door. ten older carpets were sampled in the seattle area by using the following: (1) a 3-spot test to estimate the deep dust; (2) measuring the surface dust in g/m(2) with the high-volume small simplified surface sampler; (3) vacuuming with an hvdd to extract a portion of the deep dust in g/m(2); and (4) repeating this cycle of a 3-spot test, surface dust sample, and deep dust sample until the clean-carpet criteria was reached. dust particles <150 mum were analyzed for pb. the surface dust, deep dust, and dust collection rate (g/min) decreased rapidly at first and then much more slowly as vacuuming continued. the initial 3-spot test ranged from 12 to 110 seconds (median 40). the starting surface dust loading was 0.7 to 21.1 g/m(2) (median 2.9 g/m(2)), and it decreased by 84% to 99% when the deep dust was removed. total dust-the sum of the surface dust and deep dust-ranged from 8.3 to 465 g/m(2) (median 63.2 g/m(2)). it took from 2.3 to 92 min/m(2) (median of 7.5 min/m(2)) to remove the total dust. the starting dust collection rate of 3.8 to 37 g/min decreased to final rates of 0.5 to 4.3 g/min. the 3-spot test (seconds) correlated with total dust (g/m(2)) (r = 0.63, p = 0.037) and cleaning time (min/m(2)) (r = 0.50, p = 0.12) when the data were log transformed. this study supports the utility of the 3-spot test. it tends to provide families and professional carpet cleaners with a quick and low-cost estimate of the deep dust present and the time required to clean carpets as well as indicating when the carpet is clean. deep dust tends to accumulate in older carpets and becomes surface and airborne dust after activity on a carpet. monitoring and removing the deep dust in old carpets may decrease the exposure of infants and sensitive adults to pb, allergen, and other pollutants in house dust.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
improving strategies to prevent childhood lead poisoning using local data,"lead poisoning remains an important, yet entirely preventable, disease among children worldwide. children's blood lead levels (blls) have been declining in the united states; however, nearly half a million children have blls >= 10 mu g/dl, the level targeted for elimination by 2010. attainment of this national goal will require translating knowledge into public health practice. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) funds state and local health departments to develop comprehensive prevention programs and surveillance. the jefferson county, kentucky program, which includes louisville, adopted cdc's recommendation for targeting lead testing to children at highest risk and used knowledge of risk factors for lead poisoning to develop prevention strategies. blood lead testing was targeted to louisville neighborhoods at high risk, i.e., those characterized by housing built before 1950 and valued < $50,000, which are known risk factors for blls >= 10 mu g/dl among children. we evaluated the impact of these and other interventions. testing of children aged 9-24 months who were born in high risk housing increased from 64.5% to 73.7% (p-value < 0.001) among the 1996 and 2000 birth cohorts. among the 1996 and 2000 birth cohorts, there was no significant change in testing of children born in low risk housing, i.e., built after 1950 and valued at >= $50,000 (37.0-37.5%; p-value = 0.649). this report demonstrates that applying scientific knowledge to public health practice and using surveillance and other data to evaluate practice effectively increased testing of children at high risk for lead poisoning, increased lead-safe housing, and empowered communities to protect their children from lead exposure. published by elsevier gmbh.",kentucky,kentucky,1,,screening,sociodemographic,NA

biosolids compost amendment for reducing soil lead hazards: a pilot study of orgro (r) amendment and grass seeding in urban yards,"in situ inactivation of soil pb is an alternative to soil removal and replacement that has been demonstrated in recent years at industrial sites with hazardous soil pb concentrations. most children exposed to elevated soil pb, however, reside in urban areas, and no government programs exist to remediate such soils unless an industrial source caused the contamination. modern regulated biosolids composts have low pb concentrations and low bioaccessible pb fractions and can improve grass growth on urban soils. high fe and p biosolids composts can reduce the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of soil pb and can aid in establishing vegetation that would reduce soil transfer into homes. for these reasons, we conducted a field test of their use to reduce pb bioaccessibility in urban soils in baltimore, md usa. we chose biosolids compost for its expected reduction in the bioaccessible pb fraction of urban soils, ease of use by urban residents, and ability to beautify urban areas. nine urban yards with mean soil pb concentrations > 800 mg pb kg(-1) were selected and sampled at: several distances from the house foundation before soil treatment. the soils were rototilled to 20 cm depth to prepare the sites, and resampled. the yards were then amended with 6-8 cm depth of orgro (r) biosolids compost (110-180 dry t/ha) rich in fe and p, mixed well by rototilling, and resampled. kentucky bluegrass (poa pratensis) was seeded and became well established. soils were resampled 1 year later. at each sampling time, total soil pb was measured using a modified u.s. epa nitric acid hotplate digestion method (sw 846 method 3050) and bioaccessible pb fraction was measured using the solubility/bioaccesibility research consortium standard operating procedure with modifications, including the use of glycine-buffered hcl at ph 2.2.. samples of untreated soils were collected from each yard and mixed well to serve as controls for the pb bioaccessibility of field treated soils over time independent of positional variance within yards. at 1-year post-treatment, grass cover was healthy and reductions in bioaccessible pb concentrations compared to pre-tillage were 64% (from 1655 to 595 mg kg(-1)) and 67% (from 1381 to 453 mg kg(-1)) at the sampling lines closest to the houses. little or no reduction in bioaccessible pb concentration was observed at sampling lines more remote from the house that also had the lowest bioaccessible pb concentrations at pre-tillage (620 and 436 mg kg(-1), respectively). for the control soils, changes over time in total pb and bioaccessible pb concentrations and the bioaccessible pb fraction were insignificant. this study confirms the viability of in situ remediation of soils in urban areas where children are at risk of high pb exposure from lead in paint, dust and soil.

prevalence and predictors of residential health hazards: a pilot study,"this article reports the results of a pilot study designed to ascertain the prevalence of lead-based paint (lbp), vermin, mold, and safety conditions and hazards and to validate observations and self-reports against environmental sampling data. data are based on a convenience sample of 70 dwellings in a low-income, urban neighborhood in brooklyn, new york. the vast majority of residences (96%) contained multiple conditions and/or hazards: lbp hazards (80%), vermin (79%), elevated levels of airborne mold (39%), and safety hazards (100%). observations and occupant reports were associated with environmental sampling data. in general, the more proximate an observed condition was to an actual hazard, the more likely it was to be associated with environmental sampling results (e.g.. peeling lbp was associated with windowsill dust lead levels, and cockroach sightings by tenants were associated with blatella germanica [bla g 1] levels). conversely, the more distal an observed condition was to an actual hazard, the less likely it was to be associated with environmental sampling results (e.g., water damage, alone, was not statistically v associated with elevated levels of dust lead, bla g 1, or airborne mold). based on the findings from this pilot study, there is a need for industrial hygienists and others to adopt more comprehensive and integrative approaches to residential hazard assessment and remediation. further research-using larger, randomly drawn samples, representing a range of housing types and geographical areas-is needed to clarify the relationship between readily observable conditions, occupant reports, and environmental sampling data and to assess the cumulative impact on human health.",new york,new york,1,,structure,residential,indoor

a noninvasive isotopic approach to estimate the bone lead contribution to blood in children: implications for assessing the efficacy of lead abatement,"lead hazard control measures to reduce children's exposure to household lead sources often result in only limited reductions in blood lead levels. this may be due to incomplete remediation of lead sources and/or to the remobilization of lead stores from bone, which may act as an endogenous lead source that buffers reductions in blood lead levels. here we present a noninvasive isotopic approach to estimate the magnitude of the bone lead contribution to blood in children following household lead remediation. in this approach, lead isotopic ratios of a child's blood and 5-day fecal samples are determined before and after a household intervention aimed at reducing the child's lead intake. the bone lead contribution to blood is estimated from a system of mass balance equations of lead concentrations and isotopic compositions in blood at the different times of sample collection. the utility of this method is illustrated with three cases of children with blood lead levels in the range of 18-29 microg/dl. in all three cases, the release of lead from bone supported a substantial fraction of the measured blood lead level postintervention, up to 96% in one case. in general, the lead isotopic compositions of feces matched or were within the range of the lead isotopic compositions of the household dusts with lead loadings exceeding u.s. environmental protection agency action levels. this isotopic agreement underscores the utility of lead isotopic measurements of feces to identify household sources of lead exposure. results from this limited number of cases support the hypothesis that the release of bone lead into blood may substantially buffer the decrease in blood lead levels expected from the reduction in lead intake.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
multiple metal accumulation as a factor in learning achievement within various new orleans elementary school communities,"in new orleans, the elementary school system is divided into attendance districts with established boundaries that define student enrollment among schools. this study concerns environmental quality as defined by amount of soil metals (pb, zn, cd, ni, mn, cu, co, cr, and v) in attendance district elementary school communities (n = 111) paired with learning achievement as measured by individual test scores (n = 32,741) of students enrolled at each school. the louisiana educational assessment program (leap) 4th grade scores measure learning achievement for english language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science. the best fit between environmental quality and higher learning achievement is found to be inversely associated with the sum of the metals or multiple metal accumulations (mma) in new orleans communities. the p values for mma partitions for ela, soc, mat, and sci are 0.57 x 10(-7), 0.29 x 10(-8), 0.41 x 10(-6), and 0.17 x 10(-8), respectively. efforts to prevent childhood metal exposure should improve new orleanians' learning achievement as measured by the leap scores and thereby enhance the socioeconomic situation in contaminated communities. this study establishes global relationships between leap scores in schools and soil metal concentrations in school neighborhoods. however, these data do not allow relating of the leap scores with metal levels for individual students.

"relationship of lead, mercury, mirex, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene, and polychlorinated biphenyls to timing of menarche among akwesasne mohawk girls","background. children are commonly exposed at background levels to several ubiquitous environmental pollutants, such as lead and persistent organic pollutants, that have been linked to neurologic and endocrine effects. these effects have prompted concern about alterations in human reproductive development. few studies have examined the effects of these toxicants on human sexual maturation at levels commonly found in the general population, and none has been able to examine multiple toxicant exposures. the aim of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between attainment of menarche and levels of 6 environmental pollutants to which children are commonly exposed at low levels, ie, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-dde), hexachlorobenzene (hcb), polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs), mirex, lead, and mercury. methods. this study was conducted with residents of the akwesasne mohawk nation, a sovereign territory that spans the st lawrence river and the boundaries of new york state and ontario and quebec, canada. since the 1950s, the st lawrence river has been a site of substantial industrial development, and the nation is currently adjacent to a us national priority superfund site. pcb, p, p'-dde, hcb, and mirex levels exceeding the us food and drug administration recommended tolerance limits for human consumption have been found in local animal species. the present analysis included 138 akwesasne mohawk nation girls 10 to 16.9 years of age. blood samples and sociodemographic data were collected by akwesasne community members, without prior knowledge of participants' exposure status. attainment of menses ( menarche) was assessed as present or absent at the time of the interview. congener-specific pcb analysis was available, and all 16 pcb congeners detected in > 50% of the sample were included in analyses ( international union of pure and applied chemistry numbers 52, 70, 74, 84, 87, 95, 99, 101 [ + 90], 105, 110, 118, 138 [ + 163 and 164], 149 [ + 123], 153, 180, and 187). probit analysis was used to determine the median age at menarche for the sample. binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of menarcheal status. six toxicants ( p, p'-dde, hcb, pcbs, mirex, lead, and mercury) were entered into the logistic regression model. age, socioeconomic status (ses), and bmi were tested as potential cofounders and were included in the model at p <.05. interactions among toxicants were also evaluated. results. toxicant levels were measured in blood for this sample and were consistent with long-term exposure to a variety of toxicants in multiple media. mercury levels were at or below background levels, all lead levels were well below the centers for disease control and prevention action limit of 10 mu g/dl, and pcb levels were consistent with a cumulative, continuing exposure pattern. the median age at menarche for the total sample was 12.2 years. the predicted age at menarche for girls with lead levels above the median ( 1.2 mu g/dl) was 10.5 months later than that for girls with lead levels below the median. in the logistic regression analysis, age was the strongest predictor of menarcheal status and ses was also a significant predictor but bmi was not. the logistic regression analysis that corrected for age, ses, and other pollutants ( p, p'-dde, hcb, mirex, and mercury) indicated that, at their respective geometric means, lead ( geometric mean: 0.49 mu g/dl) was associated with a significantly lower probability of having reached menarche (beta = - 1.29) and a group of 4 potentially estrogenic pcb congeners (e-pcb) ( geometric mean: 0.12 ppb; international union of pure and applied chemistry numbers 52, 70, 101 [ + 90], and 187) was associated with a significantly greater probability of having reached menarche ( beta = 2.13). predicted probabilities at different levels of lead and pcbs were calculated on the basis of the logistic regression model. at the respective means of all toxicants and ses, 69% of 12-year-old girls were predicted to have reached menarche. however, at the 75th percentile of lead levels, only 10% of 12-year-old mohawk girls were predicted to have reached menarche; at the 75th percentile of e-pcb levels, 86% of 12-year-old mohawk girls were predicted to have reached menarche. no association was observed between mirex, p, p'-dde, or hcb and menarcheal status. although bmi was not a significant predictor, we tested bmi in the logistic regression model; it had little effect on the relationships between menarcheal status and either lead or e-pcb. in models testing toxicant interactions, age, ses, lead levels, and pcb levels continued to be significant predictors of menarcheal status. when each toxicant was tested in a logistic regression model correcting only for age and ses, we observed little change in the effects of lead or e-pcb on menarcheal status. conclusions. the analysis of multichemical exposure among akwesasne mohawk nation adolescent girls suggests that the attainment of menarche may be sensitive to relatively low levels of lead and certain pcb congeners. this study is distinguished by the ability to test many toxicants simultaneously and thus to exclude effects from unmeasured but coexisting exposures. by testing several pcb congener groupings, we were able to determine that specifically a group of potentially estrogenic pcb congeners affected the odds of reaching menarche. the lead and pcb findings are consistent with the literature and are biologically plausible. the sample size, cross-sectional study design, and possible occurrence of confounders beyond those tested suggest that results should be interpreted cautiously. additional investigation to determine whether such low toxicant levels may affect reproduction and disorders of the reproductive system is warranted.",nongeographical,new york,0,akwesasne mohawk,biology,health outcome,NA
determinants of the blood lead level of us women of reproductive age,"objectives: blood lead concentration of an infant is largely affected by maternal blood lead recycling. this study aimed to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and nutritional determinants for blood lead levels (blls) of women of reproductive age in the united states. methods: subjects (n = 4,394) were women (20-49 years old) included in the most recent complete national health and nutritional survey (nhanes iii). certain sociodemographic, lifestyle and nutritional determinants for bll were identified. results: the bll of reproductive age women was 1.78 mug/dl geometric mean, the bll was inversely associated with poverty income ratio and education level, hematocrit, intake of thiamine, and serum levels of folate, and positively associated with ethnicity (black, hispanic), living in urban areas or the northeast region, age, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, serum protoporphyrin, and intake of pyridoxine, iron, and folate. subjects in the lowest decile for serum ascorbic acid had significantly higher blls than those in the 2nd through 8th deciles. conclusion: infants born to women who smoke, drink and maintain poor nutritional status for selected nutrients are at a greater risk of lead toxicity than those born to other women. nutritional manipulation of thiamine, ascorbic acid and folate may impact bll in women.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Northeast,,,
issues related to time averaging of exposure in modeling risks associated with intermittent exposures to lead,"typical exposures to lead often involve a mix of long-term exposures to relatively constant exposure levels (e. g., residential yard soil and indoor dust) and highly intermittent exposures at other locations (e. g., seasonal recreational visits to a park). these types of exposures can be expected to result in blood lead concentrations that vary on a temporal scale with the intermittent exposure pattern. prediction of short-term (or seasonal) blood lead concentrations arising from highly variable intermittent exposures requires a model that can reliably simulate lead exposures and biokinetics on a temporal scale that matches that of the exposure events of interest. if exposure model averaging times (emats) of the model exceed the shortest exposure duration that characterizes the intermittent exposure, uncertainties will be introduced into risk estimates because the exposure concentration used as input to the model must be time averaged to account for the intermittent nature of the exposure. we have used simulation as a means of determining the potential magnitude of these uncertainties. simulations using models having various emats have allowed exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to time averaging of exposures and impact on risk estimates associated with intermittent exposures to lead in soil. the international commission of radiological protection (icrp) model of lead pharmacokinetics in humans simulates lead intakes that can vary in intensity over time spans as small as one day, allowing for the simulation of intermittent exposures to lead as a series of discrete daily exposure events. the icrp model was used to compare the outcomes (blood lead concentration) of various time-averaging adjustments for approximating the time-averaged intake of lead associated with various intermittent exposure patterns. results of these analyses suggest that standard approaches to time averaging (e. g., u. s. epa) (1) that estimate the long-term daily exposure concentration can, in some cases, result in substantial underprediction of short-term variations in blood lead concentrations when used in models that operate with emats exceeding the shortest exposure duration that characterizes the intermittent exposure. alternative time-averaging approaches recommended for use in lead risk assessment (2) more reliably predict short-term periodic (e. g., seasonal) elevations in blood lead concentration that might result from intermittent exposures. in general, risk estimates will be improved by simulation on shorter time scales that more closely approximate the actual temporal dynamics of the exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
using gis-based approaches to support research on neurotoxicants and other children's environmental health threats,"environmental threats to children's health are complex and multifaceted; consequently, children's environmental health research strives to identify, areas of elevated exposure, determine whether particular demographic groups are inequitably exposed, and link exposures to incidence of disease. many environmental health researchers use geographic information systems (gis) to ex post display the results of their data collection and analysis. this methodological paper shows some ways by which the ex ante integration of gis into environmental exposure and epidemiological research can significantly enhance: research design; sampling, recruitment, and retention strategies; data management and analysis; and community translation.

risk factors for lead poisoning among cuban refugee children,"objectives. this study was designed to explore whether parental activities such as repairing cars, welding, and rebuilding car batteries are risk factors for lead poisoning among cuban refugee children in miami-dade county. methods. the authors performed a cross-sectional study of 479 children aged 1283 months who had lived in cuba during the six months prior to immigrating to the u.s. lead levels were obtained, and parents provided information on demographics, home/neighborhood environment in cuba prior to immigration, family/occupational factors prior to immigration, and child behavior factors. results. of 479 children, 30 (6.3%) had elevated blood lead levels (eblls), defined as >= 10 mu g/dl, based on the centers for disease control and prevention action level. in multivariate analysis, racial/ethnic identification other than white, living in a home built after 1979, car repair in the home or yard, eating paint chips, and male sex were independently associated with ebll. conclusions. risk factors for lead poisoning among immigrant children may differ from those among u.s.-born children. screening of immigrant children who may have been exposed in their country of origin and education of immigrant parents about lead exposure hazards associated with activities such as car repair should be considered in the design of lead poisoning prevention and control programs.",nongeographical,florida,0,Miami-Dade County,occupational,refugee/immigrant,NA
lead levels in canadian children: do we have to review the standard?,"research indicates that the blood lead levels that were once considered safe can adversely affect the neurodevelopment of children. the purpose of the present article is to review issues surrounding lead exposure in canadian children, including sources, chronic low levels of exposure, and recommendations for prevention. information was obtained through searches of medline and web of science using a combination of: """"canada"""" or """"canadian"""" plus """"child"""" or """"paediatrics"""" plus """"lead"""" or """"lead poisoning"""" or """"blood lead"""". centers for disease control and prevention data and american peer-reviewed literature were also used. on-line health canada advisories (available since 1995), as well as relevant reports from nongovernmental organization and the media, were reviewed. the present review found that there has been limited surveillance of blood lead levels of canadian children and, mainly, among high-risk groups. harmful health effects may occur below the current standards and the threat of lead in consumer products remains. the current regulation seems to be inadequate to protect canadian children.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canda,,,
health and housing collaboration at last: the philadelophia lead abatement strike team,"the lead abatement strike team (last) was developed in 2002 by the philadelphia department of public health (pdph) in response to community concern about management of children with elevated blood lead levels (eblls). fourteen hundred backlog properties (housing at least one child with eblls) were identified through inspection as having housing-based lead hazards for which no satisfactory environmental remediation (control of lead hazards) had been achieved. in the first two years of last, 834 new housing cases also were identified. the heightened awareness of this problem, sparked in part by community advocacy efforts, led to the appropriation of $1.5 million for environmental remediation. a collaborative group of health, housing, and other officials was convened. enforcement for remediation of properties with lead hazards was strengthened with the development of the lead court, a special judicial court devoted exclusively to hearing cases where owners had violated local lead poisoning prevention laws. identifying a group of pennsylvania-certified lead abatement contractors, expanding the health department's abatement team, creating temporary relocation capacity, and providing funding for basic housing system repair work were crucial to obtaining rapid remediation of homes. in the first two years of the last program, 1,037 properties (both backlog and new properties) that housed 1,476 children were remediated, representing a significant increase in remediation capacity.",nongeographical,pennsylvania,0,Philadelphia,structure,policy,NA
iq and blood lead from 2 to 7 years of age: are the effects in older children the residual of high blood lead concentrations in 2-year-olds?,"increases in peak blood lead concentrations, which occur at 18-30 months of age in the united states, are thought to result in lower iq scores at 4-6 years of age, when iq becomes stable and measurable. data from a prospective study conducted in boston suggested that blood lead concentrations at 2 years of age were more predictive of cognitive deficits in older children than were later blood lead concentrations or blood lead concentrations measured concurrently with iq. therefore, cross-sectional associations between blood lead and iq in school-age children have been widely interpreted as the residual effects of higher blood lead concentrations at an earlier age or the tendency of less intelligent children to ingest more leaded dust or paint chips, rather than as a causal relationship in older children. here we analyze data from a clinical trial in which children were treated for elevated blood lead concentrations (20-44 microg/dl) at about 2 years of age and followed until 7 years of age with serial iq tests and measurements of blood lead. we found that cross-sectional associations increased in strength as the children became older, whereas the relation between baseline blood lead and iq attenuated. peak blood lead level thus does not fully account for the observed association in older children between their lower blood lead concentrations and iq. the effect of concurrent blood level on iq may therefore be greater than currently believed.",nongeographical,massachusetts,0,Boston,achievement,health outcome,NA
"blood lead levels--united states, 1999-2002","adverse health effects caused by lead exposure include intellectual and behavioral deficits in children and hypertension and kidney disease in adults. exposure to lead is an important public health problem, particularly for young children. eliminating blood lead levels (blls) >/=10 microg/dl in children is one of the national health objectives for 2010 (objective no. 8-11). findings of national health and nutrition examination surveys (nhanes) from the period 1976-1980 to 1991-1994 reveal a steep decline (from 77.8% to 4.4%) in the percentage of children aged 1-5 years with blls >/=10 microg/dl. however, blls remain higher for certain populations, especially children in minority populations, children from low-income families, and children who live in older homes. this report updates estimates of blls in the u.s. population with the latest nhanes data, collected during 1999-2002. the findings indicated that blls continued to decrease in all age groups and racial/ethnic populations. during 1999-2002, the overall prevalence of elevated blls for the u.s. population aged >/=1 year was 0.7%. blls in non-hispanic black children remained higher than in non-hispanic white or mexican-american children, although the proportion of blls >/=10 microg/dl in this population decreased (72%) since 1991-1994. approximately 310,000 children aged 1-5 years remained at risk for exposure to harmful lead levels. public health agencies should continue efforts to eliminate or control sources of lead, screen persons at highest risk for exposure, and provide timely medical and environmental interventions for those identified with elevated blls.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
screening housing to prevent lead toxicity in children,"objective: screening children to identify those with blood lead levels > or = 10 microg/dl fails to protect children from lead-associated cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. to broaden our efforts at primary prevention, screening criteria are needed to identify lead-contaminated housing before children are unduly exposed. the purpose of this study was to identify and validate housing characteristics associated with children having elevated blood lead levels (> or = 10 microg/dl). methods: two existing studies were used to examine housing characteristics linked with undue lead exposure: a cross-sectional study of 205 children aged 12 to 31 months, and a random sample from a longitudinal study of 276 children followed from 6 to 24 months of age. logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of children's blood lead levels > or = 10 microg/dl. results: the mean age of the 481 children was 17.8 months; 99 (20.6%) had a blood lead concentration of 10 microg/dl or higher. the following characteristics were associated with blood lead concentration > or = 10 microg/dl: floor lead loading > 15 microg/ft2 (odds ratio [or]=2.2; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.3, 3.8); rental housing (or=3.2; 95% ci 1.3, 7.6); poor housing condition (or=2.1; ci 1.2, 3.6); african american race (or=3.3; ci 1.9, 6.1); paint chip ingestion (or=5.8; ci 1.3, 26.5); and soil ingestion (or=2.2; ci 1.1, 4.2). housing characteristics including rental status, lead-contaminated floor dust, and housing condition had a range of sensitivity from 47% to 92%; specificity from 28% to 76%; a positive predictive value from 25% to 34%; and a negative predictive value of 85% to 93%. conclusions: housing characteristics and floor dust lead levels can be used to screen housing to identify lead hazards prior to occupancy, before purchasing a home, or after renovation to prevent children's exposure to lead hazards.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

effectiveness of lead-hazard control interventions on dust lead loadings: findings from the evaluation of the hud lead-based paint hazard control grant program,"from 1994 to 1999, the evaluation of the us department of housing and urban development lead-based paint hazard control grant program studied the intervention experiences of over 2800 homes in 11 states in the usa. each interior intervention was categorized as (in order of increasing intensity) (a) cleaning/spot painting; (b) complete repainting; (c) complete repainting plus window treatments; (d) window abatement plus treatments to other components; (e) abatement of all lead-based paint hazards; or (f) abatement of all lead-based paint. complete dust testing and environmental data were available for 1034 and 278 dwellings through 12 and 36 months postintervention, respectively. strategies ranging from complete repainting to window abatement plus other treatments reduced geometric mean preintervention windowsill and floor dust lead loadings up to 36 months postintervention (reductions for complete repainting, from 16 to 5 mu g/ft(2) on floors and 182 to 88 mu g/ft(2) on sills; for window abatement plus other treatments, 27-8 mu g/ft(2) on floors and 570-124 mu g/ft(2) on sills). full abatement reduced windowsill and floor loadings from baseline to 12 months postintervention [95-6 mu g/ft(2) on floors and 518-30 mu g/ft(2) on sills (data were not available for this strategy at 36 months)]. window lead-hazard abatement was the most effective measure to reduce dust lead loadings on windows, but this treatment would need to be performed in conjunction with treatments to floors as well as exterior and soil treatments for the most effective control of dust lead on floors.

national evaluation of the us department of housing and urban development lead-based paint hazard control grant program: study methods,"the us department of housing and urban development (hud) undertook an evaluation of its lead hazard control grant program between 1994 and 1999. the evaluation is the largest study ever done on the effectiveness of lead hazard controls implemented in residential dwellings. the evaluation had several major objectives: determining the effectiveness of various lead hazard controls in reducing residential dust lead levels and children's blood lead levels, establishing the costs of doing lead hazard control work and factors that influence those costs, determining the rate of clearance testing failures and their causes, and identifying possible negative effects of lead hazard control work on children's blood lead levels. this paper reports the overall research design and data collection methods of the evaluation. the large number of dwelling units enrolled in the evaluation was possible only by the innovative partnership among hud, the evaluators, and the grantees. hud and the evaluators relied on the grantees for essentially all of the data collection. the 14 participating hud lead hazard control grantees were responsible for implementing the lead hazard control programs in their communities and collecting the study data. this paper describes the methods for recruiting and enrolling dwellings and families, collecting environmental and housing data, interviewing participating families, and collecting data on lead hazard control work performed and its costs. the paper also describes the basic quality control and quality assurance procedures used. the principal outcome measures were lead in dust collected using wipes from floors, window sills, and window troughs and lead in blood collected from children who were 6 years old or younger at enrollment. data collection was conducted before intervention, immediately postintervention, and 6 and 12 months postintervention. for a subset of dwellings undergoing an extended follow-up data were also collected at 24 and 36 months postintervention. this paper provides the context for subsequent reports that will describe such findings as the influence of lead hazard control work on serial dust lead levels, the influence of lead hazard control work on serial blood lead levels in children, the nature and costs of the lead hazard control work done at the dwellings, and the experience of the grantees in meeting clearance testing requirements.

testing the dose-response specification in epidemiology: public health and policy consequences for lead,"statistical evaluation of the dose-response function in lead epidemiology is rarely attempted. economic evaluation of health benefits of lead reduction usually assumes a linear dose-response function, regardless of the outcome measure used. we reanalyzed a previously published study, an international pooled data set combining data from seven prospective lead studies examining contemporaneous blood lead effect on iq (intelligence quotient) of 7-year-old children (n = 1,333). we constructed alternative linear multiple regression models with linear blood lead terms (linear-linear dose response) and natural-log-transformed blood lead terms (log-linear dose response). we tested the two lead specifications for nonlinearity in the models, compared the two lead specifications for significantly better fit to the data, and examined the effects of possible residual confounding on the functional form of the dose-response relationship. we found that a log-linear lead-iq relationship was a significantly better fit than was a linear-linear relationship for iq (p = 0.009), with little evidence of residual confounding of included model variables. we substituted the log-linear lead-iq effect in a previously published health benefits model and found that the economic savings due to u.s. population lead decrease between 1976 and 1999 (from 17.1 microg/dl to 2.0 microg/dl) was 2.2 times (319 billion dollars) that calculated using a linear-linear dose-response function (149 billion dollars). the centers for disease control and prevention action limit of 10 microg/dl for children fails to protect against most damage and economic cost attributable to lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"a critical review of biomarkers used for monitoring human exposure to lead: advantages, limitations, and future needs","lead concentration in whole blood (bpb) is the primary biomarker used to monitor exposure to this metallic element. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization define a bpb of 10 microg/dl (0.48 micromol/l) as the threshold of concern in young children. however, recent studies have reported the possibility of adverse health effects, including intellectual impairment in young children, at bpb levels < 10 microg/dl, suggesting that there is no safe level of exposure. it appears impossible to differentiate between low-level chronic pb exposure and a high-level short pb exposure based on a single bpb measurement; therefore, serial bpb measurements offer a better estimation of possible health outcomes. the difficulty in assessing the exact nature of pb exposure is dependent not so much on problems with current analytical methodologies, but rather on the complex toxicokinetics of pb within various body compartments (i.e., cycling of pb between bone, blood, and soft tissues). if we are to differentiate more effectively between pb stored in the body for years and pb from recent exposure, information on other biomarkers of exposure may be needed. none of the current biomarkers of internal pb dose have yet been accepted by the scientific community as a reliable substitute for a bpb measurement. this review focuses on the limitations of biomarkers of pb exposure and the need to improve the accuracy of their measurement. we present here only the traditional analytical protocols in current use, and we attempt to assess the influence of confounding variables on bpb levels. finally, we discuss the interpretation of bpb data with respect to both external and endogenous pb exposure, past or recent exposure, as well as the significance of pb determinations in human specimens including hair, nails, saliva, bone, blood (plasma, whole blood), urine, feces, and exfoliated teeth.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"the relationship between lead exposure, motor function and behaviour in inuit preschool children","the main focus of this study was to determine the role of behaviour in the relationship between postnatal lead exposure and motor function. the sample consisted of 110 preschoolers, of age 5, from nunavik. lead concentration was measured at birth and at testing time. average lead levels were of 4.9 mu g/dl (0.24 mu mol/l) and 5.3 mu g/dl (0.26 mu mol/l) for cord and child blood, respectively. children's balance and fine motor capacities were tested. a modified version of the ibr was used to assess behaviour. postnatal blood lead concentrations correlated positively with both impulsivity and activity. neither pre- nor postnatal blood lead concentration correlated with attention level. the children's scores on impulsivity (1) and activity (a) were summed to create the independent variable ia, which was tested as a potential mediator between lead exposure and two dependent variables: the coefficient of covariation in alternating hand movements and transversal sway in tandem position. mediation was significant only for the latter variable. ia and attention were then tested as potential moderators in the relation between postnatal lead exposure and motor function. no significant interaction between independent variables could be observed. these results do not support the hypothesis that, at low levels of postnatal exposure, lead acts indirectly on motor function via behaviour. however, ia does act as a mediator in the relationship between postnatal blood lead concentration and transversal sway in tandem position. crown copyright (c) 2005 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",NA,nongeographical,0,,,,

trends in occupational and adult lead exposure in wisconsin 1988 - 2005,"seventeen years of adult blood lead surveillance data (37,694 individuals and 71,622 total tests) reveal a wisconsin success story. while lead continues to be widely used, most wisconsin industries have made substantial strides toward reducing occupational lead exposure. the improvement is reflected in the reduced number of blood lead levels >40 microg/dl. in 2005 only a single adult blood lead test was >50 pg/dl, and since 2003 none have been reported above 60 microg/dl. however, as long as lead is used industrially, lead-based products remain in use, and new consumer products containing lead are marketed to the public, lead poisoning will remain a threat, not only to workers handling lead, but also to children exposed to lead-containing products already in existence. wisconsin industry and workers, as well as the medical and public health community, must remain vigilant about new and reemerging lead exposures. wisconsin's adult blood lead epidemiology and surveillance program will continue to investigate unusual lead exposure circumstances identified through statutorily mandated physician and laboratory reporting of adult blood lead levels. however, wisconsin will need further advances if it is to achieve the us healthy people 2010 objective of no adult blood lead level >25 microg/dl.",wisconsin,wisconsin,1,,occupational,occupational,NA
"lead levels in blood and saliva in a low-income population of detroit, michigan","the relationships between blood lead (pbb) and saliva lead (pbsa) concentrations and the determinants of pbb and pbsa status in 970 low-income adults in the city of detroit, michigan were explored. average pbb and pbsa values in the sample population were found to be 2.7+/-0.1 microg/dl and 2.4+/-0.13 microg/l (equivalent to 0.24+/-0.13 microg/dl), respectively, and a weak but statistically significant association was found between the lead levels in the two types of body fluid samples. the average pbb level for men (4.0+/-0.56 microg/dl) was higher than that for women (2.7+/-0.11 microg/dl); other significant predictors of pbb included age, level of education, being employed, income level, the presence of peeling paint on the wall at home and smoking. there was no gender- or age-dependent difference in blood saliva values but statistically significant correlations were found between pbsa and level of education, employment, income level and smoking. dental caries was severe in this population. only 0.5% of the participants had no clinical signs of caries, over 80% had cavitated carious lesions (i.e., lesions that had progressed into dentin), and the number of lost teeth and carious lesions averaged 3.4 and 30, respectively. weak but significant associations were found between pbb as well as pbsa and measures of dental caries in the study population. the positive associations are believed to be a reflection of the fact that the risk factors for dental caries, especially in low-income populations of the us, overlap extensively with those of lead poisoning and may not have a causal significance.",michigan,michigan,1,,sociodemographic,biomarker,NA

"blood lead levels in children and environmental lead contamination in miami inner city, florida","studies have shown that the environmental conditions of the home are important predictors of health, especially in low-income communities. understanding the relationship between the environment and health is crucial in the management of certain diseases. one health outcome related to the home environment among urban, minority, and low-income children is childhood lead poisoning. the most common sources of lead exposure for children are lead paint in older, dilapidated housing and contaminated dust and soil produced by accumulated residue of leaded gasoline. blood lead levels (bll) as low as 10 microg/dl in children are associated with impaired cognitive function, behavior difficulties, and reduced intelligence. recently, it is suggested that the standard for intervention be lowered to bll of 5 microg/dl. the objectives of our report were to assess the prevalence of lead poisoning among children under six years of age and to quantify and test the correlations between bll in children and lead exposure levels in their environment. this cross-sectional analysis was restricted to 75 children under six years of age who lived in 6 zip code areas of inner city miami. these locations exhibited unacceptably high levels of lead dust and soil in areas where children live and play. using the 5 microg/dl as the cutoff point, the prevalence of lead poisoning among the study sample was 13.33%. the study revealed that lead levels in floor dust and window sill samples were positively and significantly correlated with bll among children (p < 0.05). however, the correlations between bll and the soil, air, and water samples were not significant. based on this pilot study, a more comprehensive environmental study in surrounding inner city areas is warranted. parental education on proper housecleaning techniques may also benefit those living in the high lead-exposed communities of inner city miami.",florida,florida,1,,environment,residential,both
"predicting children's blood lead levels from exposure to school drinking water in seattle, washington, usa","objective: lead exposure through drinking water is of increasing interest with little known about its potential childhood health impact. in 2004, school testing in seattle, washington, found lead concentrations in drinking water that exceeded national guidelines (>20 ppb). on the basis of these data, we estimated potential blood lead levels (blls) in elementary school children to better understand the potential health risks posed by these exposures. methods: we used the us environmental protection agency integrated uptake biokinetic model for lead in children to predict geometric mean blls. we modeled typical-case and worst-case scenarios for children in 71 elementary schools on the basis of drinking water lead concentrations results from 2004. results: the estimated geometric mean blls under a typical scenario for each school ranged from 1.6 to 2.5 microg/dl. the worst-case scenario predicted geometric mean blls ranging from 1.7 to 5.0 microg/dl. all modeling yielded predicted blls well below the centers for disease control and prevention's public health goal of <10 microg/dl. conclusions: our modeling suggests drinking water exposures up to 10-15 times the environmental protection agency guideline are unlikely to result in blls exceeding the current guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention in the absence of other significant exposure sources. in seattle, elevated school drinking water lead concentrations are not a significant source of lead exposure in school-age children. further characterization of drinking water impacts are merited only if younger-age children are consuming water or if water lead concentrations are higher than those in this study.",washington,washington,1,,infrastructure,school,indoor

"windows of opportunity: lead poisoning prevention, housing affordability, and energy conservation","the authors argue that through coordinated effort, a lead-safe window replacement initiative could eliminate childhood lead poisoning while improving home energy efficiency and affordability. energy-efficient windows reduce utility bills, which increases affordability and decreases home energy use, thereby reducing pollution. this study looks at the role of window replacement in reducing the number of children with elevated blood lead levels and promoting affordability and energy conservation. the authors find that window replacement largely explains why the number of children with elevated blood lead levels decreased from 1990 to 2000, and they say that an initiative to increase window replacement rates could help to eliminate lead poisoning by 2010. they also explain how window replacement could improve home energy efficiency and affordability, reduce air pollution from power plants, and reduce other housing-related health risks. this study uses data published by the president's task force on environmental health and safety risks to children in combination with data from three federal agencies (u.s. department of housing and urban development, u.s. department of energy, and u.s. bureau of the census) to reach the conclusion that single-pane window replacement can eliminate lead poisoning by 2010. window replacement that disturbs lead paint without proper cleanup and clearance testing can increase lead dust hazards in the short term. further efforts are needed to encourage dust testing to verify proper cleanup after all rehab and window replacement are complete - including work done without federal assistance. the authors caution that meeting the challenge of eliminating childhood lead poisoning by 2010 through window replacement would require financial assistance in low-income households and additional incentives for middle- and upper-income households.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"a randomized, community-based trial of home visiting to reduce blood lead levels in children","objective: the objective of this study was to measure the effectiveness of intensive case management to reduce blood lead levels (blls) in children. lead poisoning remains a common, preventable pediatric condition despite advances in reducing children's blls in the united states. substantial evidence implicates lead paint-contaminated house dust as the most common high-dose source of lead in children's environments. housekeeping and parental supervision also may contribute to risk for lead exposure. methods: we conducted a community-based, randomized trial of comprehensive education and home visiting for families of children with blls 15 to 19 microg/dl. blls after 1 year of follow-up were compared for intervention group children, whose families received individualized education that was designed to address specific risks factors in a child's environment, and comparison group children, whose families received customary care, usually 1 or 2 educational visits. environmental samples were collected at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up for intervention group children and compared with those of comparison group children, collected only at the end of study. results: during the follow-up period, parents of intervention group children (n = 92) successfully decreased dust lead levels and significantly improved parent-child interaction and family housekeeping practices compared with comparison group children (n = 83). overall geometric mean blls declined by 47%, and the difference in bll by group was not significant (9 vs 8.3 microg/dl for intervention versus comparison group children, respectively.) after 1 year, nearly half of enrolled children had blls > or = 10 microg/dl. conclusions: until a reservoir of lead-safe housing is created, programs that educate families to reduce environmental exposure are needed. although providing families with quantitative information regarding lead contamination may have a role in short-term efforts to prevent lead exposure, these null findings suggest that it has little benefit once blls are elevated.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"blood lead concentrations in children and method of water fluoridation in the united states, 1988-1994","some have hypothesized that community water containing sodium silicofluoride and hydrofluosilicic acid may increase blood lead (pbb) concentrations in children by leaching of lead from water conduits and by increasing absorption of lead from water. our analysis aimed to evaluate the relation between water fluoridation method and pbb concentrations in children. we used pbb concentration data (n=9,477) from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-1994) for children 1-16 years of age, merged with water fluoridation data from the 1992 fluoridation census. the main outcome measure was geometric mean pbb concentration, and covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty status, urbanicity, and length of time living in residence. geometric mean pbb concentrations for each water fluoridation method were 2.40 microg/dl (sodium silicofluoride), 2.34 microg/dl (hydrofluosilicic acid), 1.78 microg/dl (sodium fluoride), 2.24 microg/dl (natural fluoride and no fluoride), and 2.14 microg/dl (unknown/mixed status). in multiple linear and logistic regression, there was a statistical interaction between water fluoridation method and year in which dwelling was built. controlling for covariates, water fluoridation method was significant only in the models that included dwellings built before 1946 and dwellings of unknown age. across stratum-specific models for dwellings of known age, neither hydrofluosilicic acid nor sodium silicofluoride were associated with higher geometric mean pbb concentrations or prevalence values. given these findings, our analyses, though not definitive, do not support concerns that silicofluorides in community water systems cause higher pbb concentrations in children. current evidence does not provide a basis for changing water fluoridation practices, which have a clear public health benefit.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
a coordinated relocation strategy for enhancing case management of lead poisoned children: outcomes and costs,"controlling residential lead hazards is critical for case management of lead poisoned children. to attain this goal, permanent relocation of the family is sometimes necessary or advisable for many reasons, including poor housing conditions; extensive lead hazards; lack of abatement resources, landlord compliance and local enforcement capacity; and family eviction. during 1996-1998, the kennedy krieger institute implemented a unique capitated program for case management of baltimore city children with blood lead concentrations (pbb) >19 microg/dl. the program provided financial, housing, and social work assistance to facilitate relocation as a means of providing safer housing. nearly half of the program families relocated with direct assistance, and 28% relocated on their own. the program evaluation examined the costs and benefits of relocation. average relocation cost per child was relatively inexpensive (<1,500 dollars). average relocation time of 5 months (range <2 months to >12 months) was less than the 8-month average time to complete lead hazard control work in 14 city and state programs funded by u.s. hud. relocation was associated with (1) a statistically significant decrease in dust lead loadings on floors, windowsills and window troughs that persisted for one year, and (2) statistically significantly greater decreases in children's pbb compared to children who did not relocate from untreated homes. children relocated to housing that met current federal residential dust lead standards had statistically significant decreases in blood lead levels. visual inspection did not consistently identify relocation houses with dust lead levels below current federal standards, indicating that dust testing should be an essential component of future programs. this will require additional resources for dust testing and possibly cleaning and repairs but is expected to yield additional benefits for children. the findings support recent u.s. cdc case management recommendations suggesting that permanent relocation to safer housing is a viable means to reduce children's lead exposure. the benefits of relocation notwithstanding, 40% of families moved at least twice. research is needed to better understand how to expedite relocation and encourage families to remain in safe housing. relocation does not negate owners' and health authorities' responsibilities to address lead hazards in the child's original house in order to protect future occupants.",nongeographical,maryland,0,Baltimore,economic,policy,NA
a survey of spatially distributed exterior dust lead loadings in new york city,"this work documents ambient lead dust deposition values (lead loading) for the boroughs of new york city in 2003-2004. currently, no regulatory standards exist for exterior concentrations of lead in settled dust. this is in contrast to the clearance and risk assessment standards that exist for interior residential dust. the reported potential for neurobehavioral toxicity and adverse cognitive development in children due to lead exposure prompts public health concerns about undocumented lead sources. such sources may include settled dust of outdoor origin. dust sampling throughout the five boroughs of nyc was done from the top horizontal portion of pedestrian traffic control signals (ptcs) at selected street intersections along main thoroughfares. the data (n = 214 samples) show that lead in dust varies within each borough with brooklyn having the highest median concentration (730 mu g/ft(2)): followed in descending order by staten island (452 mu g/ft(2)), the bronx (382 mu g/ft(2)), queens (198 mu g/ft(2)) and finally, manhattan (175 mu g/ft(2)). when compared to the hud/epa indoor lead in dust standard of 40 pg/ft(2), our data show that this value is exceeded in 86% of the samples taken. an effort was made to determine the source of the lead in the dust atop of the ptcs. the lead in the dust and the yellow signage paint (which contains lead) were compared using isotopic ratio analysis. results showed that the lead-based paint chip samples from intact signage did not isotopically match the dust wipe samples taken from the same surface. we know that exterior dust containing lead contributes to interior dust lead loading. therefore, settled leaded dust in the outdoor environment poses a risk for lead exposure to children living in urban areas, namely, areas with elevated childhood blood lead levels and background lead dust levels from a variety of unidentified sources.

an exterior and interior leaded dust deposition survey in new york city: results of a 2-year study,"environmental concentrations of leaded dust were monitored by weekly sample collection of interior and exterior settled dust that had accumulated due to atmospheric deposition. the weekly deposition amounts were measured and the cumulative rates of lead in dust that deposited on a weekly basis over 2 year's time were determined. the sampling analysis revealed that the median values of leaded dust for the interior plate (adjacent to the open window), unsheltered exterior plate, and the sheltered exterior plate were 4.8, 14.2, and 32.3 mu g/feet(2)/week, respectively. the data supports the existence of a continuous source of deposited leaded dust in interior and exterior locations within new york city. additional data from a control plate (interior plate with the window closed) demonstrate that the source of the interior lead deposition was from exterior (environmental) sources. because of the ubiquitous nature of lead in our environment and the toxic threat of lead to the cognitive health of children, this data provides a framework for the understanding of environmental exposure to lead and its potential for continuing accumulation within an urban environment.

the bioaccessibility of lead (pb) from vacuumed house dust on carpets in urban residences,"risk assessments for toxicants in environmental media via oral exposure often rely on measurements of total concentration in a collected sample. however, the human digestive system cannot dissolute all of a toxicant present in the binding matrix, and cannot absorb it with nearly 100% efficiency. in vitro bioaccessibility has been developed as a method to estimate oral bioavailability of a toxicant using a physiologically-based extraction procedure. bioaccessibility measurements are more physiologically relevant than strong acid leaching measurements of concentration. a method for measuring bioaccessible lead in house dust was derived from the bioaccessibility method currently used for heavy metals in contaminated soils. house dust was collected from carpets in typical urban residences. bioaccessible lead was measured in house dust (< 75 mu m) from the homes of 15 participants. the bioaccessibility ranged from 52.4% to 77.2% in gastric fluid, and 4.9% to 32.1% in intestinal fluid. house dust samples from five homes were analyzed to assess the relationship among lead bioaccessibility of three particle size fractions (< 75, 75-150, and 150-250 mu m). changes in lead bioaccessibility as a function of particle size fraction were not significant for gastric fluid (p= 0.7019); however they were significant for intestinal fluid (p= 0.0067). this decrease of bioaccessibility may result from the readsorption of dissolved lead onto the dust particles or precipitation of lead with phosphates in a high-ph environment. the bioaccessibility data obtained for two biofluids were applied to the ieubk model, and results for intestinal bioaccessibility of lead provide support for the model default value of 30% lead bioavailability of dust as a reasonable population indicator for dose, but the higher values for gastric bioaccessibility of lead appeared to provide an upper bound that approached actual blood lead levels in the children living in the studied homes. this upper bound seemed to overcome some of the limitations of the model when it lacks child-specific activity data and characterization of all exposure routes.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
integrated assessment of environment and health: america's children and the environment,"the significance of the environment for health is increasingly being recognized. there is a need for systematic approaches to assessment of environmental factors most relevant to health, health outcomes most influenced by the environment, and the relationships between them, as well as for approaches to representing the results of such assessments in policy deliberations. as a step in the development of such methods, we used findings and data from the environmental protection and public health sectors to develop a set of measures representing topics relevant to children's environmental health. we used a definition of the environment that emphasized contaminants and a process that involved both analytic and deliberative elements. the steps in this process were to a) develop a conceptual framework to depict relationships between environment and health with relevant types of data and information, b) select topic areas of significance for children, c) identify best available data sources and devise measures, d) assess possible surrogate data sources and measures when needed, e) design and implement metrics for computation of measures using specified data elements, f) select graphical representations of measures, g) identify related measures, and 15) identify data gaps. representatives of policy and stakeholder audiences participated in this process. the measures are presented in three groups that reflect contaminants in the environment, contaminants in human tissues, and diseases and disorders. the measures present scientifically based representations of data understandable to stakeholders and policy makers that integrate key information from the health and environment sectors in a consistent format.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
using biologic markers in blood to assess exposure to multiple environmental chemicals for inner-city children 3-6 years of age,"we assessed concurrent exposure to a mixture of > 50 environmental chemicals by measuring the chemicals or their metabolites in the blood of 43 ethnically diverse children (3-6 years of age) from a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood in minneapolis. over a 2-year period, additional samples were collected every 6-12 months from as many children as possible. we analyzed blood samples for 11 volatile organic compounds (vocs), 2 heavy metals (lead and mercury, 11 organochlorine (oc) pesticides or related compounds, and 30 polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb) congeners. the evidence suggests that numerous vocs originated from common sources, as did many pcbs. longitudinal measurements indicate that between-child variance was greater than within-child variance for two vocs (benzene, toluene), for both heavy metals (pb, hg), for all detectable oc pesticides, and for 15 of the measured pcb congeners (74, 99, 101, 118, 138-158, 146, 153, 156, 170, 178, 180, 187, 189, 194, 195). despite the relatively small sample size, highest measured blood levels of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, styrene, m-/p-xylene, pb, hg, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p -dde), trans-nonachlor, and pcb congeners 74, 99, 105, 118, 138, 146, 153, 156, 170, and 180 were comparable with or higher than 95th percentile measurements of older children and adults from national surveys. results demonstrate that cumulative exposures to multiple environmental carcinogens and neurotoxins can be comparatively high for children from a poor inner-city neighborhood.",nongeographical,minnesota,0,Minneapolis,environment,screening,NA
childhood lead poisoning: the torturous path from science to policy,"the long history of lead poisoning provides many lessons about the process by which scientific knowledge is translated into public health policy. in the united states, lead was added to paint and to gasoline in enormous quantities long after medical evidence clearly showed that excessive lead exposure caused considerable morbidity in the population. this article discusses some of the factors that contributed to the slow pace of efforts to address this problem, including the ubiquity and magnitude of lead exposure during much of the twentieth century, which produced a distorted notion about the blood lead level that can be considered """"normal""""; the prevailing model of disease during this period, notably the novelty of the concept of subclinical disease; the fact that childhood lead poisoning affected mostly families that were politically and economically disenfranchised, fostering a """"blame the victim"""" attitude; and that controlling lead exposure would have impeded efforts to achieve other desirable goals, illustrating the role that value trade-offs often play in policy decisions.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"economic costs of childhood diseases and disabilities attributable to environmental contaminants in washington state, usa","this study estimates the economic costs associated with childhood diseases and disabilities attributable to environmental contaminants in washington state, usa, including asthma, cancer, lead exposure, birth defects, and neurobehavioral disorders. the estimates are based on """"cost of illness"""" models that include direct healthcare costs and indirect costs. the estimates are also based on an """"environmentally attributable fraction"""" model which quantifies the proportions of each disease or disability that can reasonably be attributed to environmental contaminants. the study concludes that the annual cost of selected childhood diseases and disabilities attributable to environmental contaminants in washington state is $1875 million in 2004 $, comprising $310.6 million in direct healthcare costs and $1565 million in indirect costs, and with a range of $1600-$2200 million a year. these estimates are consistent with other studies. like the previous studies, a significant proportion of the estimated costs can be attributed to lead exposure. this estimate is equivalent to about 0.7% of the total washington gross state product, and the estimated direct healthcare costs are equivalent to at least 0.2% of the total washington state health expenditures. these costs could be lessened or prevented if exposures to environmental contaminants were reduced or eliminated. this study argues for the need for an ecosystem approach to human health in which the condition of the environment, in terms of exposures to environmental contaminants, must be addressed taking a systemic perspective.",nongeographical,washington,0,,economic,policy,NA
a rationale for lowering the blood lead action level from 10 to 2 mu g/dl,"fifteen years ago, in 1991, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) established 10 mu g/dl as the lowest level of concern for children's blood lead levels. this value is extremely important because, historically, policy makers and public health officials generally have acted to remove sources of lead exposure only after the cdc's level of concern had been exceeded. a growing body of evidence, however, reveals that blood lead levels below 10 mu g/dl may impair neurobehavioral development. there is now sufficient and compelling scientific evidence for the cdc to lower the blood lead action level in children. this review argues that a level of 2 mu g/dl is a useful and feasible replacement. although it can be argued, in turn, that no threshold for the health effects of lead is demonstrable, analytically a blood level of 2 mu g/dl is readily and accurately measured and provides a benchmark for successful prevention. lowering the level of concern would encourage and accelerate the investments needed to ensure that children are protected from lead exposure in their homes, schools, and play settings. such a program would also offer economic advantages because of the coupling between lead, educational attainment, earnings and anti-social conduct. by lowering the blood action level, cdc will promote policies and initiatives designed to further reduce children's exposure to this potent developmental neurotoxicant.

trials and tribulations of protecting children from environmental hazards,"society is increasingly aware of the profound impact that the environment has on children's health. not surprisingly, there is increasing public scrutiny about children's exposures to environmental hazards, especially for disadvantaged children. these trends underscore the ethical imperative to develop a framework to protect children from environmental hazards. such a framework must include regulations to test new chemicals and other potential hazards before they are marketed, a strategy to conduct research necessary to protect children from persistent hazards that are widely dispersed in their environment, stronger regulatory mechanisms to eliminate human exposures to recognized or suspected toxicants, and guidelines about the ethical conduct of research and the role of experimental trials that test the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent or ameliorate children's exposure to persistent toxicants or hazards that are widely dispersed in their environment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
mass transfer of soil indoors by track-in on footwear,"inadvertent soil ingestion, especially by young children, can be an important route of exposure for many environmental contaminants. the introduction of exterior soil into the interior environment is a significant element of the exposure pathway. the unintentional collection of outside soil on footwear followed by subsequent deposition indoors is a principal route of soil ingress. here we have investigated likely rates of dry and wet soil deposition on indoor hard surface flooring as a result of mass transfer from soiled footwear. in this pilot study, testing involved both single track-in events (with deposition resulting from a single progression of transfer steps) and multiple tracking actions (with deposition and dispersion resulting from repeated transfer steps). based on soil mass recovery from the floor surface it was found that any contamination introduced by one-time track-in events was of limited spatial extent. in contrast, under repeated tracking conditions, with multiple soil incursions, widespread floor surface contamination was possible. soil mass recovery was accomplished by brushing, by vacuum cleaner removal and by wet wiping. all the clean-up methods operated imperfectly and failed to remove all initially deposited soil. the level of floor surface soiling that resulted from the track-in tests, and the incomplete clean-up strongly suggest that under unrestricted transfer conditions rapid accumulation and dispersal of soil on indoor flooring is likely.

validation of a 20-year forecast of us childhood lead poisoning: updated prospects for 2010,"we forecast childhood lead poisoning and residential lead paint hazard prevalence for 1990-2010, based on a previously unvalidated model that combines national blood lead data with three different housing data sets. the housing data sets, which describe trends in housing demolition, rehabilitation, window replacement, and lead paint, are the american housing survey, the residential energy consumption survey, and the national lead paint survey. blood lead data are principally from the national health and nutrition examination survey. new data now make it possible to validate the midpoint of the forecast time period. for the year 2000, the model predicted 23.3 million pre-1960 housing units with lead paint hazards, compared to an empirical hud estimate of 20.6 million units. further, the model predicted 498,000 children with elevated blood lead levels (ebl) in 2000, compared to a cdc empirical estimate of 434,000. the model predictions were well within 95% confidence intervals of empirical estimates for both residential lead paint hazard and blood lead outcome measures. the model shows that window replacement explains a large part of the dramatic reduction in lead poisoning that occurred from 1990 to 2000. here, the construction of the model is described and updated through 2010 using new data. further declines in childhood lead poisoning are achievable, but the goal of eliminating children's blood lead levels > or =10 microg/dl by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved without additional action. a window replacement policy will yield multiple benefits of lead poisoning prevention, increased home energy efficiency, decreased power plant emissions, improved housing affordability, and other previously unrecognized benefits. finally, combining housing and health data could be applied to forecasting other housing-related diseases and injuries.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

hurricane katrina's impact on new orleans soils treated with low lead mississippi river alluvium,"before hurricane katrina flooded 80% of new orleans, 25 heavily pb contaminated properties were treated with 15 cm of low pb mississippi river alluvium from the bonnet carre spillway (bcs). four phases of soil collection on the properties included pretreatment (phase 1) median surface soil pb was 1051 mg/kg (range 5 - 19 627); after bcs cover (phase 2) the median soil pb decreased to 6.3 mg/kg (range 3 - 18); just before katrina, a soil collection was partially completed (phase 3); and finally, a post-katrina collection (phase 4) on all 25 properties. twenty-three properties were flooded. the objective was to compare pb changes of phases 2 and 3 pre-katrina with the post-katrina (phase 4) soil collection. the post-katrina soil pb (phase 4) (median of 16.3, range 5.5 - 1,155) increased significantly (p-value) 3.7 x 10(-10)) from the clean soil, phase 2 results. matched soil samples collected in phase 3 before flooding and phase 4 after flooding showed that on initially vacant lots the amounts of pb were not significantly different (p-value = 0.97); but, on properties with homes, the changes were significant (p-value = 0.03). after catastrophic flooding, the clean soil remained relatively undisturbed; the soil pb changes were small with increases of median pb of 12 and 6 mg/kg for vacant lots and properties with homes, respectively. processes accounting for pb increases include pb-based paint abatement on one property, home construction on the vacant lots, and resuspension and deposition of pb dust. as part of the post-katrina recovery, the combined benefits of pb-safe paint abatement or renovation and clean soil cover should outweigh the estimated annual cost of pb poisoning of children returning to new orleans.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,abatement,outdoor
distribution of lead in urban roadway grit and its association with elevated steel structures,"in an effort to determine the source of exterior lead contamination, we investigated the concentration of lead in roadway grit along major thoroughfares in new york city and in certain areas under elevated steel structures supporting elevated rails. such structures represent only one source of lead in roadway grit. while data revealed that the median lead concentration in roadway grit did not exceed the standard for a lead hazard in bare residential soil in any borough, the limit of 400 mu g/g was exceeded 22%, 18%, 10.5%, and 7.7% of the time in manhattan, brooklyn, the bronx, and queens, respectively. the second part of the study revealed the presence of high concentrations of lead in roadway grit directly under elevated steel structures. the differences in the concentration of lead in roadway grit under steel structures in comparison to areas in nyc not near elevated rails was statistically significant. of the eight sites studied from 225 total samples, the median roadway grit lead level was 340 ppm, while the level under steel structures was 1480 ppm. preliminary efforts to determine particle size distribution revealed that 84% of the particles were in the range of 125-500 mu m, but the highest concentration of lead was in the smallest fraction analyzed (< 63 mu m). lead contamination of roadway grit from restoration of elevated painted steel structures is a public health problem as these lead particulates get re-suspended in the ambient environment and are wafted and tracked into residences.

"an economic impact assessment of lead exposure in the commonwealth of kentucky, usa: making the case for statewide remediation","childhood lead poisoning is a major, preventable environmental health problem in the usa. the primary source of lead poisoning in children is exposure to deteriorating lead-based paint in older low-quality, low-income housing. the circumstance of concentrated poverty and the shortage of high quality low-income housing provide a recipe for increasing disease rates attributed to lead exposure. this paper assesses the economic impact of lead exposure in high-risk housing among children residing in the commonwealth of kentucky as measured by productivity and tax revenues lost. it examines remediation costs of high-risk housing statewide against the costs of exposure. specifically, it examines the relationships between iq and earnings potential, lost earnings and tax revenue generation, remediation costs and the cost of exposure, and it evaluates these costs against exposure reduction and suggests a strategy for comprehensive remediation activities that pays for itself over time. the results of this analysis determine that the long-term benefits of reducing the outcomes associated with lost productivity among young children per year due to lead exposure would generate sufficient tax revenue to pay for complete remediation of all high risk low-quality housing units in kentucky.",kentucky,kentucky,1,,economic,policy,NA

changes in blood lead levels associated with use of chloramines in water treatment systems,"background: more municipal water treatment plants are using chloramines as a disinfectant in order to reduce carcinogenic by-products. in some instances, this has coincided with an increase in lead levels in drinking water in those systems. lead in drinking water can be a significant health risk. objectives: we sought to test the potential effect of switching to chloramines for disinfection in water treatment systems on childhood blood lead levels using data from wayne county, located in the central coastal plain of north carolina. methods: we constructed a unified geographic information system (gis) that links blood lead screening data with age of housing, drinking water source, and census data for 7,270 records. the data were analyzed using both exploratory methods and more formal multivariate techniques. results: the analysis indicates that the change to chloramine disinfection may lead to an increase in blood lead levels, the impact of which is progressively mitigated in newer housing. conclusions: introducing chloramines to reduce carcinogenic by-products may increase exposure to lead in drinking water. our research provides guidance on adjustments in the local childhood lead poisoning prevention program that should accompany changes in water treatment. as similar research is conducted in other areas, and the underlying environmental chemistry is clarified, water treatment strategies can be optimized across the multiple objectives that municipalities face in providing high quality drinking water to local residents.",north carolina,north carolina,1,,infrastructure,water treatment,NA

the association between demolition activity and children's blood lead levels,"urban renewal efforts are a priority for many american cities. as efforts to reconstitute urban centers increase, the demolition of old, deteriorated structures has accelerated. recent studies have identified demolitions as a potential source of environmental lead exposure. we conducted a study examining the relationship between demolition activity and blood lead levels of children residing in neighborhoods where demolition activity occurred. a retrospective cohort study was conducted in st. louis city, missouri. the study period was january 1, 2002 to december 31, 2002. data were obtained from the missouri childhood lead poisoning prevention program's (clppp) lead surveillance system and st. louis demolition permit database. children were considered exposed to a demolition if they had a blood lead test within 45 days of any demolition on a census block. exposure was classified as both a dichotomous (yes/no) and a categorical (none/one/multiple) variable and was analyzed separately. linear regression models were developed to determine effects of demolitions on blood lead levels. a total of 1196 children 6-72 months of age living in 395 census blocks were included. 314 (26.3%) were exposed and 882 (73.7%) were unexposed to a demolition. in an adjusted model, exposure to multiple demolitions was found to have significant effects on children blood lead levels (coefficient=0.281; 95% ci=0.069, 0.493; p-value=0.010). age of the child, race, and age of housing where children's resided were also significant predictors. this study suggests that multiple demolitions within a census block may significantly increase children's blood lead levels. the findings may be useful to municipal planners in older cities where demolitions are being used as an urban renewal tool.",missouri,missouri,1,,structure,environment,NA
"elevated lead in drinking water in washington, dc, 2003-2004: the public health response","background: in 2003, residents of the district of columbia (dc) experienced an abrupt rise in lead levels in drinking water, which followed a change in water-disinfection treatment in 2001 and which was attributed to consequent changes in water chemistry and corrosivity. objectives: to evaluate the public health implications of the exceedance, the dc department of health expanded the scope of its monitoring programs for blood lead levels in children. methods: from 3 february 2004 to 31 july 2004, 6,834 dc residents were screened to determine their blood lead levels. results: children from 6 months to 6 years of age constituted 2,342 of those tested; 65 had blood lead levels > 10 microg/dl (the """"""""level of concern"""""""" defined by the centers for disease control and prevention), the highest with a level of 68 microg/dl. investigation of their homes identified environmental sources of lead exposure other than tap water as the source, when the source was identified. most of the children with elevated blood lead levels (n = 46; 70.8%) lived in homes without lead drinking-water service lines, which is the principal source of lead in drinking water in older cities. although residents of houses with lead service lines had higher blood lead levels on average than those in houses that did not, this relationship is confounded. older houses that retain lead service lines usually have not been rehabilitated and are more likely to be associated with other sources of exposure, particularly lead paint. none of 96 pregnant women tested showed blood lead levels > 10 microg/dl, but two nursing mothers had blood lead levels > 10 microg/dl. among two data sets of 107 and 71 children for whom paired blood and water lead levels could be obtained, there was no correlation (r(2) = -0.03142 for the 107). conclusions: the expanded screening program developed in response to increased lead levels in water uncovered the true dimensions of a continuing problem with sources of lead in homes, specifically lead paint. this study cannot be used to correlate lead in drinking water with blood lead levels directly because it is based on an ecologic rather than individualized exposure assessment; the protocol for measuring lead was based on regulatory requirements rather than estimating individual intake; numerous interventions were introduced to mitigate the effect; exposure from drinking water is confounded with other sources of lead in older houses; and the period of potential exposure was limited and variable.",NA,district of columbia,0,,environment,screening,indoor
"globalization, binational communities, and imported food risks: results of an outbreak investigation of lead poisoning in monterey county, california","objectives. although the burden of lead poisoning has decreased across developed countries, it remains the most prevalent environmental poison worldwide. our objective was to investigate the sources of an outbreak of lead poisoning in monterey county, california. methods. an investigation in 3 county health department clinics in monterey county, california, was conducted between 2001 and 2003 to identify risk factors for elevated blood lead levels (>= 10 mu g/dl) among children and pregnant women. results. the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels was significantly higher in 1 of the 3 clinics (6% among screened children and 13% among prenatal patients). risk factors included eating imported foods (relative risk [rr] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.2, 9.5) and having originated from the zimatlan area of oaxaca, mexico, compared with other areas of oaxaca (rr = 4.0; 95% ci = 1.7, 9.5). home-prepared dried grasshoppers (chapulines) sent from oaxaca were found to contain significant amounts of lead. conclusions. consumption of foods imported from oaxaca was identified as a risk factor for elevated blood lead levels in monterey county, california. lead-contaminated imported chapulines were identified as 1 source of lead poisoning, although other sources may also contribute to the observed findings. food transport between binational communities presents a unique risk for the importation 900-906.",california,california,1,,nutrition,refugee/immigrant,NA
"do the same houses poison many children? an investigation of lead poisoning in rochester, new york, 1993-2004","objectives. in several cities, researchers have found that a discrete number of properties owned by a small number of owners house multiple lead poisoned children over time. the purpose of this study was to determine whether or not a small number of properties were implicated in the poisoning of multiple children in rochester, new york, between 1993 and 2004. methods. we analyzed the patterns of ownership and repeated positive environmental investigations (i.e., documented lead hazards) in homes of lead poisoned children using county health department data during a 12-year period. results. a small percentage (14.8%) of properties in which the health department found a lead hazard had previously documented lead hazards. when a second positive investigation occurred, the average elapsed time between investigations was a little less than three years. only four property owners owned more than two properties that had multiple positive investigations. conclusions. in some cities, a small number of properties or property owners provide housing for a large percentage of lead poisoned children. however, this situation is not universal. in rochester, a relatively small percentage of homes that housed a child with an elevated blood lead level have a history of housing lead poisoned children. in cities like rochester, lead hazard reduction resources should focus on high-risk housing stock determined by factors such as age, value, and condition, rather than on those with a prior record of housing lead poisoned children.",new york,new york,1,,structure,residential,NA
northern idaho house dust and soil lead levels compared to the bunker hill superfund site,"house dust has been identified as a major exposure medium for lead (pb) in children. high levels of pb in soil and house dust have been recorded at the bunker hill superfund site (bhss) in northern idaho, an historic mining and smelting district. soil and dust remediation at the site was required; however, regional background soil and dust pb levels had not been well characterized. the objective of this survey was to determine background house dust pb levels and to compare those levels with concentrations, and dust and pb loading rates measured at the bhss. soil and house dust samples were collected in five towns demographically similar to the bhss but unaffected by the mining industry. the background concentrations and loading rates were significantly lower than those observed at the site. house age was a significant factor affecting background soil and house dust pb concentrations and loading rates.",idaho,idaho,1,,environment,residential,indoor
using state lead poisoning surveillance system data to assess false positive results of capillary testing,"objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the false positive percentage of capillary blood lead screening in a statewide surveillance system and to explore potential predictors of false positive results. methods: data were all blood lead tests of 0-5 year old children in maine during 2002-2003. we determined the proportion of children with elevated (>/=10 microg/dl) capillary test results who received a venous confirmatory test, and calculated the percentage of false positive tests, defined as a capillary test of >/=10 microg/dl with a confirmatory venous test of <10 microg/dl. multivariable binomial regression was used to determine whether capillary blood lead level and length of time between capillary and venous tests predicted false positive results, after controlling for potential confounders. we also examined the positive bias of the capillary test among both false positive and true positive results. results: seventy-three percent of elevated capillary screening tests (2.2 percent of all capillary screening tests) were false positives. false positive results were less likely for capillary levels of 15-19 microg/dl (rr=0.78; 95% ci 0.5-0.92) and 20 microg/dl or above (rr=0.83; 95% ci 0.71-0.96) compared to 10-14 microg/dl. the percentage of false positives did not vary by interval between screening and confirmatory tests. the capillary test exhibited a positive bias compared to the venous test, even among true positive results. conclusions: false positive results may have been caused by sample contamination, rather than laboratory error or true variation in blood lead level between screening and confirmatory tests. capillary screening could be improved by training in proper sample collection methods.",maine,maine,1,,screening,methods,NA
"nonlinear association between soil lead and blood lead of children in metropolitan new orleans, louisiana: 2000-2005","metropolitan new orleans is unique because it has a universal blood lead (bl) screening dataset (n=55,551) from 2000-2005 spatially coupled with a soil lead (sl) dataset (n=5467) completed in 2000. we evaluated empirical associations between measurements of sl and bl exposure responses of children in new orleans by stratifying the databases by census tracts and statistically analyzing them with permutation methods. a consistent curvilinear association occurred annually between sl and bl with robust significance (p-values<10(-23)). the mathematical model of the pooled bl datasets for 2000-2005 is: bl=2.038+0.172 x (sl)(0.5) (agreement (r) of 0.534, an r(2) of 0.528, and a p-value of 1.0 x 10(-211)) indicating that chance alone cannot explain the association. below 100 mg/kg sl children's bl exposure response is steep (1.4 microg/dl per 100 mg/kg), while above 300 mg/kg sl the bl exposure response is gradual (0.32 microg/dl per 100 mg/kg). in 1995, the bl prevalence was 37%>or=10 microg/dl for the most vulnerable poor and predominantly african-american children. in the era of universal screening the prevalence of elevated bl is 11.8%>or=10 microg/dl for the general population of children. the sl map describes community variations of potential bl exposure. if health effects occur at bl>or=2 microg/dl, then 93.5% of the children in new orleans are at risk. these results reinforce the proposal that prevention of childhood pb exposure must include sl remediation as demonstrated by a new orleans pilot project and a proactive norwegian government program.",louisiana,louisiana,1,,environment,environment,outdoor
friction and impact surfaces: are they lead-based paint hazards?,"professionals who identify residential lead-based paint hazards and develop lead hazard control plans are instructed to assess painted friction and impact surfaces in homes as potentially active sources of dust lead, a known exposure vector for young children. however, empirical tests of the importance of these surfaces had not been conducted. using data collected as part of a 1998 three-community study of the housing and urban development lead risk assessment protocols, this article explores how much rubbing or binding on friction and impact surfaces on windows and doors influence dust lead levels on windowsills and floors, while taking into account paint condition on these surfaces and other sources of lead. the analyses included windowsill dust wipe samples from 611 rooms in 182 homes and 782 floor dust wipe samples collected in 209 rooms from 104 homes. the study found that when the paint on windows is intact but the window is rubbing or binding, the dust lead levels on the windowsills are significantly higher than on windows with intact paint without rubbing or binding, after controlling for other lead sources. windowsill dust lead on a window with intact lead-based paint at 1 mg/cm(2) and no rubbing/binding would be 27% lower than on a window with nonintact paint, rubbing/binding surfaces, or both of these conditions. an independent effect of rubbing/binding of doors on floor dust lead loadings was not observed. these findings support federal regulations calling for lead risk assessors to check the friction/impact surfaces at windows when dust lead samples taken below them are elevated, but these analyses did not offer support for taking extra observations of friction/impact surfaces around doors.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,indoor
the effect of housing compliance status on children's blood lead levels,"in a secondary analysis of data from the childhood lead poisoning prevention program of philadelphia (july 1, 1999 through september 1, 2004), the authors evaluated the effect of housing compliance status and time to achieve compliance on changes in children's blood lead levels. blood lead level changes were not significantly different between children living in compliant housing and those living in noncompliant housing for periods of 1.5 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, or more than 3 years (-11.01 microg/dl, -9.72 microg/dl, -12.5 microg/dl, -11.57 microg/dl, and -14.31 microg/dl, and -14.61 microl, respectively). in a stratified analysis of children younger than 2 years, the authors also found no association. neither a house's lead hazard control status nor the time it took to achieve compliance affected long-term changes in children's lead levels. current compliance programs may be helpful for primary prevention but did not impact change in blood lead for exposed children.",nongeographical,pennsylvania,0,Philidelphia,structure,abatement,NA
elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women: identification of a high-risk population and interventions,"there has been a significant decrease in the number of preschool children with elevated blood lead levels (bill), from 88.2 to 4.4 per 10,000 children over the last three decades as shown by national health and nutritional examination survey (nhanes) data. however, there are still certain high-risk populations that have not been well studied. one such group is that of pregnant women. during pregnancy, bll tends to increase due to greater bone turnover, which causes release of lead stored in bone. this increase may not affect the pregnant woman's health directly but could be extremely harmful to the rapidly developing central nervous system in the fetus as it crosses the placenta easily. this current study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of elevated bll in pregnant women in a community hospital, monitor the effect of routine preventive practices on maternal bill, and to elucidate the relationship between maternal and neonatal bill and their anthropometric indices. a retrospective chart review was conducted on all hospital deliveries occurring in the first six years after the initiation of universal blood lead screening of pregnant women (n=6880). the prevalence of elevated lead ( >= 10 mu g/dl) in our patient population was 1.7%. the factors associated with elevated lead levels were recent immigration to the us, poor socioeconomic status and low educational levels. simple interventions such as hand washing as well as calcium and iron supplementation significantly reduced maternal bill from 16.82 +/- 9.5 to 11.48 +/- 9.3 mu g/dl (p<0.0001). a significant correlation (r = 0.4, p < 0.007) is present between the post-intervention but not the pre-intervention maternal bill and the neonatal bill. given the vulnerability of the developing fetal brain and that cns complications are associated with elevated lead levels, antenatal lead screening should be part of routine prenatal care. simple preventive measures may play a role in decreasing maternal bll and thereby decreasing transplacental transfer of lead to the fetus.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
relationships of video assessments of touching and mouthing behaviors during outdoor play in urban residential yards to parental perceptions of child behaviors and blood lead levels,"childrens' touching and mouthing behaviors during outdoor play in urban residential yards were measured using video observations. descriptions were made of childrens' outdoor residential play environments. behaviors assessed were used to examine (1) validity of parental responses to questions on childrens' oral behaviors and outdoor play and (2) relationships of mouthing behaviors to blood lead levels (blls). thirty-seven children aged 1-5 years were recruited for 2 h of video recording in their yard and blood lead measurement. video assessments included hourly rates of hand touches to ground/walking-level surfaces (cement/stone/steel, porch floor/steps, grass, and bare soil) and oral behaviors. parental questionnaires assessed their child's outdoor activities, behaviors, and home environment. the children were: mean 39 months; 51% male; 89% hispanic; and 78% medicaid or uninsured. twenty-two children had a blood lead measured (mean 6 microg/dl). during taping, all children had access to cement, 92% to grass, 73% to bare soil, and 59% to an open porch. children had frequent touching and mouthing behaviors observed (median touches/h: touches to surfaces 81; hand-to-mouth area (with and without food) 26; hand-in-mouth 7; and object-in-mouth 17). blood lead was directly correlated with log-transformed rates of hand-in-mouth (pearson's correlation, r=0.564, n=22, p=0.006) and object-in-mouth (pearson's correlation, r=0.482, n=22, p=0.023) behaviors. parental questionnaire responses did not accurately reflect childrens' observed oral behaviors, play habits, or play environment. these data confirm the direct relationship between hand-to-mouth activities and blls and fail to validate parental perceptions of their child's mouthing behaviors or outdoor play environment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

elevated blood lead concentrations and vitamin d deficiency in winter and summer in young urban children,"background: it is widely recognized that blood lead concentrations are higher in the summer than in winter. although the effects of some environmental factors such as lead in dust on this phenomenon have been studied, relationships to sunlight-induced vitamin d synthesis have not been adequately investigated. vitamin d status is influenced by the diet, sunlight exposure, age, skin pigmentation, and other factors, and may modify gastrointestinal lead absorption or release of lead stored in bones into the bloodstream. objective and methods: we collected paired blood samples from 142 young, urban african-american and hispanic children in the winter and summer to study the seasonal increase in blood lead and its relationships to vitamin d nutrition, age, and race. results: a winter/summer (w/s) increase in blood lead concentrations of 32.4% was found for children 1-3 years of age. there was a smaller w/s increase of 13.0% in children 4-8 years of age. none of the 51 hispanic children had an elevated blood lead concentration (> or = 10 microg/dl) during the winter, and only one had an elevated summertime concentration. in contrast, elevated blood lead concentrations were frequent in the 91 african-american children, especially those 1-3 years of age. for the latter, the percentage with elevated blood lead levels increased from 12.2% in winter to 22.5% in summer. a 1.2% w/s increase in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin d (serum 25-oh-d) concentrations was found for children 1-3 years of age. however, in children 4-8 years of age the w/s increase in serum 25-oh-d was much larger-33.6%. the percentages of children with low (< 16 microg/l) serum 25-oh-d concentrations were 12.0% in winter and 0.7% in summer and were consistently greater in african-american than in hispanic children. the seasonal increases in blood lead and serum 25-oh-d in children 4-8 years of age were significantly associated. conclusion: the higher summertime serum 25-oh-d concentrations for the 4- to 8-year-old children are likely caused by increased sunlight-induced vitamin d synthesis and may contribute to the seasonal increase in blood lead. age and race are key factors that affect blood lead and vitamin d nutrition, as well as their interactions, in young urban children.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

blood lead (pb) levels: a potential environmental mechanism explaining the relation between socioeconomic status and cardiovascular reactivity in children,"objective: a number of studies have shown an association between socioeconomic status (ses) and cardiovascular reactivity to acute stress. in addition, the authors recently reported that higher early childhood blood lead (pb) levels are associated with significantly greater total peripheral (vascular) resistance (tpr) responses to acute stress. it is not known whether the ses-tpr association is mediated by underlying differences in blood lead levels. design: participants were 9.5-year-old children (n = 122) with established early childhood blood lead levels. main outcome measures: family ses was measured using the hollingshead index, blood lead levels were abstracted from pediatrician and state records, and children's cardiovascular responses to acute stressors were measured in the laboratory with impedance cardiography and an automated blood pressure monitor. results: lower family ses was shown to be associated with significantly higher blood lead levels as well as significantly heightened systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and tpr responses to acute stress tasks. a mediational analysis confirmed that pb was a significant mediator of the ses-tpr reactivity association; some evidence also suggested moderation. conclusion: these results suggest the importance of considering the chemical environment as well as social and psychological environment when evaluating cardiovascular effects of low ses.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
reliability of spot test kits for detecting lead in household dust,"there has been a long-standing need for a technique that can provide fast, accurate and precise results regarding the presence of hazardous levels of lead in settled house dust. several home testing kits are now available. one kit manufactured by hybrivet (leadcheck swabs) is advertised as able to detect lead dust levels that exceed the us environmental protection agency's dust lead standard for floors (40 mu g/ft(2)). the purpose of the study was to determine the ability of leadcheck swabs to instantly detect lead in dust above epa's hazard standard. a trained risk assessor collected 200 leadcheck swab samples side-by-side with standard dust wipe samples. the result of the leadcheck swab (positive (pink or red) or negative (yellow to brown)) was compared with the laboratory results for the corresponding dust wipe (over or under 40 mu g/ft(2)). the leadcheck swabs produced a false negative rate of 64% (95% confidence interval: 55%, 72%). the likelihood of a swab producing a false negative depended on substrate (painted or non-painted) and surface type (floor or sill). changing the interpretation rule by classifying all swab colors except yellow as positive yielded lower false negative rates under some test conditions, but still produced high error rates. leadcheck swabs do not reliably detect levels of lead in dust above 40 mu g/ft(2) using published methods under field conditions. further research into alternate methodologies and interpretation guidance is needed to determine whether the swabs can be appropriately used by consumers and others to test homes for lead dust hazards.

(2) sifw has been shown to interfere with cholinergic function. unlike the fully ionized state of fluoride (f-) in water treated with sodium fluoride (nafw), the sif anion, [sif6]2- in sifw releases f- in a complicated dissociation process. small amounts of incompletely dissociated [sif6]2- or low molecular weight (lmw) silicic acid (sa) oligomers may remain in sifw. a german phd study found that sifw is a more powerful inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (ache) than nafw. it is proposed here that sifw induces protein mis-folding via a mechanism that would affect polypeptides in general, and explain dental fluorosis, a tooth enamel defect that is not merely """"cosmetic"""" but a """"canary in the mine"""" foretelling other adverse, albeit subtle, health and behavioral effects. efforts to refute evidence of such effects are analyzed and rebutted. in 1999 and 2000, senior epa personnel admitted they knew of no health effects studies of sifs. in 2002 sifs were nominated for ntp animal testing. in 2006 an nrc fluoride study committee recommended such studies. it is not known at this writing whether any had begun.

the relation of low-level prenatal lead exposure to behavioral indicators of attention in inuit infants in arctic quebec,"the aim of this study was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to lead (pb) and several aspects of behavioral function during infancy through examiner ratings and behavioral coding of video recordings. the sample consisted of 169 11-month-old inuit infants from arctic quebec. umbilical cord and maternal blood samples were used to document prenatal exposure to pb. average blood pb levels were 4.6 mug/dl and 5.9 mug/dl in cord and maternal samples respectively. the behavior rating scales (brs) from the bayley scales of infant development (bsid-ii) were used to assess behavior. attention was assessed through the brs and behavioral coding of video recordings taken during the administration of the bsid-ii. whereas the examiner ratings of behaviors detected very few associations with prenatal pb exposure, cord blood pb concentrations were significantly related to the direct observational measures of infant attention, after adjustment for confounding variables. these data provide evidence that increasing the specificity and the precision of the behavioral assessment has considerable potential for improving our ability to detect low-to-moderate associations between neurotoxicants, such pb and infant behavior.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

interpreting and managing blood lead levels of less than 10 microg/dl in children and reducing childhood exposure to lead: recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention,"lead is a common environmental contaminant. lead exposure is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the united states. in children, lead is associated with impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. in 1991, the centers for disease control and prevention defined the blood lead level that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dl. concurrently, the centers for disease control and prevention also recognized that a blood lead level of 10 microg/dl did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at blood lead levels of < 10 microg/dl. in this report we provide information to help clinicians understand blood lead levels < 10 microg/dl, identify gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outline strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. we also summarize scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead-exposure risk assessment. to aid in the interpretation of blood lead levels, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within +/-2 microg/dl. clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead-prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. as circumstances permit, clinicians should consider referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and more frequent rescreening of children with blood lead levels approaching 10 microg/dl. in addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. for these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
application of a stochastic model to estimate children's short-term residential exposure to lead,"the cumulative and aggregate simulation of exposure (case) framework is an innovative simulation tool for exploring non-dietary exposures to environmental contaminants. built upon the dermal exposure reduction model (derm) and established methods for collecting detailed human activity patterns, the case framework improves upon its predecessor. although prompted in part by the food quality protection act of 1996 and the need to assess aggregate exposure to pesticides, the framework was designed to be flexible enough to assess exposure to other contaminants. this paper examines features of the case framework in an illustrative application estimating children's dermal and non-dietary ingestion exposure to lead in the residential environment. concentration values in various media are taken from a nationwide study and exposure factors are obtained from the literature. activity pattern input includes sequential micro-level activities collected for 20 children (ages 1 through 6). modeled results are explored via classification trees and sensitivity analysis. results of each exposure route are also compared to independent data. median dermal exposure estimates were 589 and 558 mu g/m(3) for the right and left hands, respectively, with the resulting output most sensitive to exposure factor terms. the simulation estimated a median non-dietary ingestion rate of 9.5 mu g of lead per day with estimates most sensitive to the surface area of mouthed objects.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"urban gardens: lead exposure, recontamination mechanisms, and implications for remediation design","environmental lead contamination is prevalent in urban areas where soil represents a significant sink and pathway of exposure. this study characterizes the speciation of lead that is relevant to local recontamination and to human exposure in the backyard gardens of roxbury and dorchester, ma, usa. one hundred forty-one backyard gardens were tested by x-ray fluorescence, and 81% of gardens have lead levels above the us epa action limit of 400 mu g/g. raised gardening beds are the in situ exposure reduction method used in the communities to promote urban gardening. raised beds were tested for lead and the results showed that the lead concentration increased from an initial range of 150 +/- 40 mu g/g to an average of 336 mu g/g over 4 years. the percent distribution of lead in the fine grain soil (< 100 mu m) and the trace metal signature of the raised beds support the conclusion that the mechanism of recontamination is wind-transported particles. scanning electron microscopy and sequential extraction were used to characterize the speciation of lead, and the trace metal signature of the fine grain soil in both gardens and raised gardening beds is characteristic of lead-based paint. this study demonstrates that raised beds are a limited exposure reduction method and require maintenance to achieve exposure reduction goals. an exposure model was developed based on a suite of parameters that combine relevant values from the literature with site-specific quantification of exposure pathways. this model suggests that consumption of homegrown produce accounts for only 3% of children's daily exposure of lead while ingestion of fine grained soil (< 100 mu m) accounts for 82% of the daily exposure. this study indicates that urban lead remediation on a yard-by-yard scale requires constant maintenance and that remediation may need to occur on a neighborhood-wide scale.

metal concentrations in rural topsoil in south carolina: potential for human health impact,"rural areas are often considered to have relatively uncontaminated soils; however few studies have measured metals in surface soil from low population areas. many metals, i.e., arsenic (as), lead (pb), and mercury (hg), have well-documented negative neurological effects, and the developing fetus and young children are particularly at risk. using a medicaid database, two areas were identified: one with no increased prevalence of mental retardation and developmental delay (mr/dd) (strip 1) and one with significantly higher prevalence of mr/dd (strip 2) in children compared to the state-wide average. these areas were mapped and surface soil samples were collected from 0-5 cm depths from nodes of a uniform grid laid out across the sampling areas. samples were analyzed for as, barium (ba), beryllium (be), chromium (cr), copper (cu), pb, manganese (mn), nickel (ni), and hg. inverse distance weighting (idw) was used to estimate concentrations throughout each strip area, and a principal component analysis (pca) was used to identify common sources. all metal concentrations in strip 2, the mr/dd cluster area, were significantly greater than those in strip 1 and similar to those found in more urban and highly agricultural areas. both strips 1 and 2 had a high number of significant correlations between metals (33 for strip 1 and 25 for strip 2), suggesting possible similar natural or anthropogenic sources which was corroborated by pica. while exposures were not assessed and direct causation between environmental soil metal concentrations and mr/dd cannot be concluded, the high metal concentrations in areas with an elevated prevalence of mr/dd warrants further consideration.

monetary benefits of preventing childhood lead poisoning with lead-safe window replacement,"previous estimates of childhood lead poisoning prevention benefits have quantified the present value of some health benefits, but not the costs of lead paint hazard control or the benefits associated with housing and energy markets. because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the us, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). the benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 us housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. these other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life. in addition, such a window replacement effort would reduce peak demand for electricity, carbon emissions from power plants, and associated long-term costs of climate change.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

low level environmental lead exposure--a continuing challenge,"the current threshold for lead toxicity, defined as a blood lead level of 10 microg/dl, was adopted by the united states (us) centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in 1991 and the world health organization in 1995. since that time, adverse health outcomes at blood lead levels below this threshold have been well demonstrated. most concern probably relates to children of pre-school age; an international pooled analysis has demonstrated lead-associated intellectual deficits at blood lead levels well below 10 microg/dl. in the case of adults, several convincing population studies have shown a positive association between blood lead and risk of death. the largest such study compared mortality information from participants with blood lead levels in the highest third of the blood lead distribution (3.6 microg/dl or greater) with those in the lowest third (less than 1.9 microg/dl). after adjustment for potential confounders, estimates of the excess risk were 25% for all cause mortality and 55% for cardiovascular mortality. the adverse consequences of lead exposure have no discernible blood lead threshold, implying there is no safety margin at existing exposure levels. despite marked declines in population mean blood lead levels since 1980, low level environmental lead exposure remains a significant public health concern.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"re-evaluation of blood mercury, lead and cadmium concentrations in the inuit population of nunavik (québec): a cross-sectional study","background: arctic populations are exposed to mercury, lead and cadmium through their traditional diet. studies have however shown that cadmium exposure is most often attributable to tobacco smoking. the aim of this study is to examine the trends in mercury, lead and cadmium exposure between 1992 and 2004 in the inuit population of nunavik (northern québec, canada) using the data obtained from two broad scale health surveys, and to identify sources of exposure in 2004. methods: in 2004, 917 adults aged between 18 and 74 were recruited in the 14 communities of nunavik to participate to a broad scale health survey. blood samples were collected and analysed for metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and dietary and life-style characteristics were documented by questionnaires. results were compared with data obtained in 1992, where 492 people were recruited for a similar survey in the same population. results: mean blood concentration of mercury was 51.2 nmol/l, which represent a 32% decrease (p < 0.001) between 1992 and 2004. mercury blood concentrations were mainly explained by age (partial r2 = 0.20; p < 0.0001), and the most important source of exposure to mercury was marine mammal meat consumption (partial r2 = 0.04; p < 0.0001). in 2004, mean blood concentration of lead was 0.19 mumol/l and showed a 55% decrease since 1992. no strong associations were observed with any dietary source, and lead concentrations were mainly explained by age (partial r2 = 0.20.; p < 0.001). blood cadmium concentrations showed a 22% decrease (p < 0.001) between 1992 and 2004. once stratified according to tobacco use, means varied between 5.3 nmol/l in never-smokers and 40.4 nmol/l in smokers. blood cadmium concentrations were mainly associated with tobacco smoking (partial r2 = 0.56; p < 0.0001), while consumption of caribou liver and kidney remain a minor source of cadmium exposure among never-smokers. conclusion: important decreases in mercury, lead and cadmium exposure were observed. mercury decrease could be explained by dietary changes and the ban of lead cartridges use likely contributed to the decrease in lead exposure. blood cadmium concentrations remain high and, underscoring the need for intensive tobacco smoking prevention campaigns in the nunavik population.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
urban soil-lead (pb) footprint: retrospective comparison of public and private properties in new orleans,"lead (pb) is a toxin that after childhood exposure poses a lifetime of health risks. one route of exposure is soil-pb as a result of similar to 12 million metric tons of pb residue in paint and gasoline sold in the us during the 20th century. pb accumulated in soil of the community is a good predictor for blood pb of children living there. this retrospective study compares the soil-pb on housing authority of new orleans (hano) properties with adjacent private residential (res) properties within a 0.8 km (0.5 mile) radius. the sample subset (n = 951) is from two soil-pb surveys (total n = 9,493) conducted between 1989 and 2000. the properties were in both the inner city (core) and outlying (outer) communities. the data were analyzed using multi-response permutation procedures (mrpp). the soil-pb results differ significantly (p-value < 0.001) on same-aged hano properties at different locations; thus, year of construction does not give adequate explanation for the soil-pb differences. hano and res soils are significantly more pb contaminated in the core than in outer communities (p-value < 0.001). the core has many more years of traffic congestion than outer communities; therefore, the lead additives to gasoline, and not lead-based paint, best elucidate the differences of the soil-pb footprint at hano and res properties in the core and outer communites. currently hano properties are being redeveloped with cleaner soil, but soil on res properties in the core of new orleans remains a large source of pb (median = 707 mg/kg in this study) for human exposure, especially children.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,residential,outdoor

global approach to reducing lead exposure and poisoning,"lead poisoning is an important environmental disease that can have life-long adverse health effects. most susceptible are children, and most commonly exposed are those who are poor and live in developing countries. studies of children's blood-lead levels (blls) are showing cognitive impairment at increasingly lower blls. lead is dangerous at all levels in children. the sources of lead exposure vary among and within countries depending on past and current uses. sources of lead may be from historic contamination, recycling old lead products, or from manufacturing new products. in all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average population blls have declined rapidly. in many developing countries where leaded gasoline is no longer used, many children and workers are exposed to fugitive emissions and mining wastes. unexpected lead threats, such as improper disposal of electronics and children's toys contaminated with lead, continue to emerge. the only medical treatment available is chelation, which can save lives of persons with very high blls. however, chelating drugs are not always available in developing countries and have limited value in reducing the sequelae of chronic low dose lead exposure. therefore, the best approach is to prevent exposure to lead. because a key strategy for preventing lead poisoning is to identify and control or eliminate lead sources, this article highlights several major sources of lead poisoning worldwide. in addition, we recommend three primary prevention strategies for lead poisoning: identify sources, eliminate or control sources, and monitor environmental exposures and hazards. published by elsevier b.v.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead in women's and children's vitamins,"a survey was conducted to determine the extent of lead (pb) contamination in vitamins labeled for use by women and children. the pb content of 324 multivitamin-mineral products was determined using microwave assisted nitric acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. cryogenic grinding was used to composite soft samples such as oil filled capsules and candy-like products such as gummies and jelly beans. estimates of pb exposures from consumption of these products were derived for four population groups: young children (0-6 yrs), older children (7+ yrs), pregnant or lactating women, and adult women. the estimated median and maximum pb exposures were 0.123 and 2.88 mu g/day for young children, 0.356 and 1.78 mu g/day for older children, 0.845 and 8.97 mu g/day for pregnant and lactating women, and 0.842 and 4.92 mu g/day for adult women. the overall median value for pb exposure was 0.576 mu g/day. five samples would have provided exposures that exceeded 4 mu g/day. estimates of exposures were assessed with respect to safe/tolerable exposure levels that have been developed for the specific age and sex groups. these safe/tolerable levels are referred to as the provisional total tolerable intake levels (ptti) and are 6, 15, 25, and 75 mu g pb/day for young children, older children, pregnant or lactating women, and adult women, respectively. estimates of pb exposures were below the ptti levels for the four population groups. median and maximum values were used instead of the mean and standard deviation because of the skewed distribution of results toward lower mass fraction and exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead neurotoxicity and socioeconomic status: conceptual and analytical issues,"socioeconomic status (ses) is usually considered to be a potential confounder of the association between lead exposure and children's neurodevelopment, but experimental and epidemiological data suggest that ses might also modify lead neurotoxicity. the basis of this effect modification is uncertain, but might include differences among ses strata in co-exposures to other neurotoxicants, genetic susceptibilities, environmental enrichment, and stress. the role of ses in the causal nexus is likely to include other dimensions, however. it conveys information about lead exposure opportunities as well as about predictors of child outcome that are correlated with but causally independent of lead. failure to distinguish these aspects of ses will lead to an underestimate of lead's contribution, and might even result in attributing to ses health effects that should be attributed to lead. conventional models, which treat ses and ses-related factors solely as potential confounders, do not capture the possibility that a child's early lead exposure alters the behaviors that the child elicits from others. failure to model lead's contribution to such time-varying covariates will also tend to bias estimates of lead neurotoxicity toward the null. on a trans-generational level, low ses might be a proxy for vulnerability to lead. to estimate the burden of lead-associated neurotoxicity on a population level, we need to apply analytical approaches that model a child's development and its context as a complex system of interdependent relationships that change over time.

hormonal contraception and blood lead levels in inner-city adolescent girls,"study objective: physiological states of estrogen deficiency can lead to bone demineralization. lead is stored in bone and may be released into blood during demineralization. the contraceptive injection depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (dmpa) is associated with estrogen deficiency and bone demineralization and, we hypothesized, may be associated with toxic blood lead levels in adolescents at high risk for lead exposure. we sought to compare blood lead levels in inner-city adolescent girls using dmpa with levels in those using oral contraceptive pills (ocp) and those taking no hormones and to examine the influence of lead exposure and reproductive history on blood lead levels in the total sample. design: cross-sectional survey of a clinical convenience sample. setting: inner-city adolescent clinic in an academic medical center. participants: 174 females aged 13-21 years; 86% minority ethnicity. interventions: none. main outcome measures: measurement of blood lead levels and an 82-item questionnaire examining lead exposure and reproductive history. results: 28 subjects were using dmpa, 25 used ocps, and 121 used no hormones. mean blood lead level in the total sample of 174 was 1.6 mug/dl, sd = 1.1. many subjects had environmental risk factors for lead exposure and 15% reported one or more past pregnancies. mean blood lead levels for subjects with the various environmental and reproductive risk factors ranged from 1.2 microg/dl to 2.0 microg/dl and were not different from levels for subjects without such risk factors. mean blood lead levels for subjects in the 3 hormonal groups were significantly different (2.1 vs. 1.2 vs.1.5 microg/dl in dmpa, ocp, and no hormone groups respectively, p = 0.007). we dichotomized the blood lead levels into """"high"""" > or =4 microg/dl, or """"low"""" <4 microg/dl. we found that a significantly higher proportion of girls using dmpa (4/28) than those not using any hormone (2/121) had """"high"""" levels (p = 0.012). conclusions: despite reported high-risk exposure to lead and the possibility of long-term accumulation of lead in bone, we did not find elevated blood levels in our sample. however, dmpa-treated girls were significantly more likely to have higher mean blood lead levels than ocp users and non-hormone users. in addition, dmpa users were more likely to have blood lead levels more than two standard deviations above the mean for the sample as a whole than untreated girls. further studies are needed to examine low-level lead poisoning in adolescents and the consequences of contraceptive choices on bone health.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"lead exposures in u.s. children, 2008: implications for prevention","objective: we reviewed the sources of lead in the environments of u.s. children, contributions to children's blood lead levels, source elimination and control efforts, and existing federal authorities. our context is the u.s. public health goal to eliminate pediatric elevated blood lead levels (ebls) by 2010. data sources: national, state, and local exposure assessments over the past half century have identified risk factors for ebls among u.s. children, including age, race, income, age and location of housing, parental occupation, and season. data extraction and synthesis: recent national policies have greatly reduced lead exposure among u.s. children, but even very low exposure levels compromise children's later intellectual development and lifetime achievement. no threshold for these effects has been demonstrated. although lead paint and dust may still account for up to 70% of ebls in u.s. children, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention estimates that >or=30% of current ebls do not have an immediate lead paint source, and numerous studies indicate that lead exposures result from multiple sources. ebls and even deaths have been associated with inadequately controlled sources including ethnic remedies and goods, consumer products, and food-related items such as ceramics. lead in public drinking water and in older urban centers remain exposure sources in many areas. conclusions: achieving the 2010 goal requires maintaining current efforts, especially programs addressing lead paint, while developing interventions that prevent exposure before children are poisoned. it also requires active collaboration across all levels of government to identify and control all potential sources of lead exposure, as well as primary prevention.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

human geography of new orleans' high-lead geochemical setting,"previous soil lead studies in new orleans focused on the geochemical footprint and its health impacts. this study examines the human geography of race, income, and age in pre-katrina metropolitan new orleans within the context of lead accumulation in soils. sample points of soil lead data (n = 5,467) collected in 1998-2000 were mapped in a geographic information system (gis), binned into 9 ranges, and queried by (1) 2000 census racial demographic data, (2) 1999 median household income, and (3) 2000 age data. the absolute population generally declines as lead levels increase except at lead levels from 200-400 to 400-1,000 mg/kg when population increases; the african-american population comprises a disproportionate share of this cohort. the high-lead areas occur in the inner city, home to the largest populations of african-americans in new orleans. the mean household income curve indicates that lower economic groups are at risk to higher levels of lead. a total of 44,701 children under the age of 5 years, plus 123,579 children aged 5-17, lived in census block groups containing at least one sample point with over 100 mg/kg lead, and these include 23,124 and 64,064 young people, respectively, who live near at least one point over 400 mg/kg. lead exposure affects a panoply of outcomes that influence the health and welfare of the community. unless corrected, children are likely to return to the same or, because of lack of lead-safe practices during renovation, even higher exposure risks than before the flooding of new orleans.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,exploratory,sociodemographic,outdoor

risk remaining from fine particle contaminants after vacuum cleaning of hard floor surfaces,"in the indoor environment, settled surface dust often functions as a reservoir of hazardous particulate contaminants. in many circumstances, a major contributing source to the dust pool is exterior soil. young children are particularly susceptible to exposure to both outdoor derived soil and indoor derived dust present in the indoor dust pool. this is because early in life the exploratory activities of the infant are dominated by touching and mouthing behavior. inadvertent exposure to dust through mouth contact and hand-to-mouth activity is an inevitable consequence of infant development. clean-up of indoor dust is, in many circumstances, critically important in efforts to minimize pediatric exposure. in this study, we examine the efficiency of vacuum cleaner removal of footwear-deposited soil on vinyl floor tiles. the study utilized a 5 x 10 foot (c. 152.5 x 305 cm) test surface composed of 1-foot-square (c. 30.5 x 30.5 cm) vinyl floor tiles. a composite test soil with moderately elevated levels of certain elements (e.g., pb) was repeatedly introduced onto the floor surface by footwear track-on. the deposited soil was subsequently periodically removed from randomly selected tiles using a domestic vacuum cleaner. the mass and loading of soil elements on the tiles following vacuuming were determined both by wet wipe collection and by subsequent chemical analysis. it was found that vacuum cleaner removal eliminated much of the soil mass from the floor tiles. however, a small percentage of the mass was not removed and a portion of this residual mass could be picked up by moistened hand-lifts. furthermore, although the post-vacuuming tile soil mass was sizably reduced, for some elements (notably pb) the concentration in the residual soil was increased. we interpret this increased metal concentration to be a particle size effect with smaller particles (with a proportionately higher metal content) remaining in situ after vacuuming.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

urban airborne lead: x-ray absorption spectroscopy establishes soil as dominant source,"background despite the dramatic decrease in airborne lead over the past three decades, there are calls for regulatory limits on this potent pediatric neurotoxin lower even than the new (2008) us environmental protection agency standard. to achieve further decreases in airborne lead, what sources would need to be decreased and what costs would ensue? our aim was to identify and, if possible, quantify the major species (compounds) of lead in recent ambient airborne particulate matter collected in el paso, tx, usa. methodology/principal findings we used synchrotron-based xafs (x-ray absorption fine structure) to identify and quantify the major pb species. xafs provides molecular-level structural information about a specific element in a bulk sample. pb-humate is the dominant form of lead in contemporary el paso air. pb-humate is a stable, sorbed complex produced exclusively in the humus fraction of pb-contaminated soils; it also is the major lead species in el paso soils. thus such soil must be the dominant source, and its resuspension into the air, the transfer process, providing lead particles to the local air. conclusions/significance current industrial and commercial activity apparently is not a major source of airborne lead in el paso, and presumably other locales that have eliminated such traditional sources as leaded gasoline. instead, local contaminated soil, legacy of earlier anthropogenic pb releases, serves as a long-term reservoir that gradually leaks particulate lead to the atmosphere. given the difficulty and expense of large-scale soil remediation or removal, fugitive soil likely constrains a lower limit for airborne lead levels in many urban settings.",texas,texas,1,,environment,environment,outdoor

screening for lead poisoning: a geospatial approach to determine testing of children in at-risk neighborhoods,"objective: to develop a spatial strategy to assess neighborhood risk for lead exposure and neighborhood-level blood lead testing of young children living in the city of atlanta, georgia. study design: this ecologic study used existing blood lead results of children aged <or=36 months tested and living in one of atlanta's 236 neighborhoods in 2005. geographic information systems used census, land parcel, and neighborhood spatial data to create a neighborhood priority testing index on the basis of proxies for poverty (special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children [wic] enrollment) and lead in house paint (year housing built). results: in 2005, only 11.9% of atlanta's 18,627 children aged <or=36 months living in the city had blood lead tests, despite a high prevalence of risk factors: 75,286 (89.6%) residential properties were built before 1978, and 44% of children were enrolled in wic. linear regression analysis indicated testing was significantly associated with wic status (p < .001) but not with old housing. conclusions: this neighborhood spatial approach provided smaller geographic areas to assign risk and assess testing in a city that has a high prevalence of risk factors for lead exposure. testing may be improved by collaboration between pediatricians and public health practitioners.",georgia,georgia,1,,screening,sociodemographic,NA
factors associated with the seasonality of blood lead levels among preschool wisconsin children,"context: aggregate blood lead testing data for wisconsin children younger than age 6 exhibit seasonal trends in both average blood lead levels and in the percent of those tested and found to have blood lead levels in excess of the 10 mcg/dl threshold for poisoning. blood lead levels and poisoning rates typically peak during the late summer and early fall months, and are at their minimum during the late winter. method: blood test data was analyzed to determine variations by month and age. results: seasonal variations are evident even among the very young: infants younger than 10 months who likely have limited opportunity to encounter lead hazards within their home or in the outdoor soil. seasonal periodicity is most evident among infants who reside in very urban and very rural communities. the observed seasonal periodicity might be associated with the seasonal availability of lead within the children's environment. particulate matter data measured at several ambient air quality monitoring stations exhibit a similar periodic seasonality, suggesting a possible relationship between blood lead levels and the availability of dust and airborne particulates during the summer months. conclusion: clinicians should consider the seasonality of blood lead levels when scheduling tests and interpreting test results.",wisconsin,wisconsin,1,,seasonal,screening,outdoor
"blood lead levels and growth status among african-american and hispanic children in dallas, texas--1980 and 2002: dallas lead project ii","objective: the purpose of this investigation is to analyze childhood blood lead levels and growth status (ages 2-12) in dallas, texas lead smelter communities in the 1980s and 2002, where smelters operated from 1936 to 1990. methods and materials: a sample of convenience study design was used in two cohorts (n=360): 1980-1989 (n=191) and 2002 (n=169). multivariate analysis of variance and covariance and tandem multiple regressions were used to evaluate the association between stature and blood lead level in two time periods. results: in 2002 average child blood lead level (1.6 microg/dl+/-0.2 se) was significantly (p<0.001) lower compared to the 1980 cohort mean level (23.6 microg/dl+/-1.3 se). average height and weight in 2002 were 4.5 cm and 4.0 kg greater, respectively, than in 1980. lowered blood lead level was associated with 3.9 cm, 3.5 kg and 1.1 units greater height, weight and body mass index (bmi), respectively. cohort effect was associated with greater height (0.6 cm), weight (0.5 kg) and bmi (0.1). conclusion: this investigation reports on child growth in a community before and after the transition from high to low blood lead levels over several decades. using child growth as a proxy, health status of dallas's lead smelter communities increased markedly over the past two decades, primarily because of lower blood lead levels, while the poverty rate was only marginally lower.",texas,texas,1,,sociodemographic,health outcome,NA
"childhood lead poisoning associated with lead dust contamination of family vehicles and child safety seats - maine, 2008","persons employed in high-risk lead-related occupations can transport lead dust home from a worksite through clothing, shoes, tools, or vehicles. during 2008, the maine childhood lead poisoning prevention program (mclppp) identified 55 new cases of elevated (>or=15 microg/dl) venous blood lead levels (blls) among children aged <6 years through mandated routine screening. although 90% of childhood lead poisoning cases in maine during 2003-2007 had been linked to lead hazards in the child's home, no lead-based paint or dust or water with elevated lead levels were found inside the homes associated with six of the 2008 cases (i.e., five families, including one family with two affected siblings). an expanded environmental investigation determined that these six children were exposed to lead dust in the family vehicles and in child safety seats. the sources of the lead dust were likely household contacts who worked in high-risk lead exposure occupations. current recommendations for identifying and reducing risk from take-home lead poisoning include 1) ensuring that children with elevated blls are identified through targeted blood lead testing, 2) directing prevention activities to at-risk workers and employers, and 3) improving employer safety protocols. state and federal prevention programs also should consider, when appropriate, expanded environmental lead dust testing to include vehicles and child safety seats.",maine,maine,1,,dust,occupational,NA

hunting with lead: association between blood lead levels and wild game consumption,"background: wild game hunting is a popular activity in many regions of the united states. recently, the presence of lead fragments in wild game meat, presumably from the bullets or shot used for hunting, has raised concerns about health risks from meat consumption. objective: this study examined the association between blood lead levels (pbb) and wild game consumption. methods: we recruited 742 participants, aged 2-92 years, from six north dakota cities. blood lead samples were collected from 736 persons. information on socio-demographic background, housing, lead exposure source, and types of wild game consumption (i.e., venison, other game such as moose, birds) was also collected. generalized estimating equations (gee) were used to determine the association between pbb and wild game consumption. results: most participants reported consuming wild game (80.8%) obtained from hunting (98.8%). the geometric mean pbb were 1.27 and 0.84 microg/dl among persons who did and did not consume wild game, respectively. after adjusting for potential confounders, persons who consumed wild game had 0.30 microg/dl (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.44 microg/dl) higher pbb than persons who did not. for all game types, recent (<1 month) wild game consumption was associated with higher pbb. pbb was also higher among those who consumed a larger serving size (> or = 2 oz vs. <2 oz); however, this association was significant for 'other game' consumption only. conclusions: participants who consumed wild game had higher pbb than those who did not consume wild game. careful review of butchering practices and monitoring of meat-packing processes may decrease lead exposure from wild game consumption.",north dakota,north dakota,1,,gun,ammunition,NA
migration of contaminated soil and airborne particulates to indoor dust,"we have developed a modeling and measurement framework for assessing transport of contaminated soils and airborne particulates into a residence, their subsequent distribution indoors via resuspension and deposition processes, and removal by cleaning and building exhalation of suspended particles. the model explicitly accounts for the formation of house dust as a mixture of organic matter (om) such as shed skin cells and organic fibers, soil tracked-in on footwear, and particulate matter (pm) derived from the infiltration of outdoor air. we derived formulas for use with measurements of inorganic contaminants, crustal tracers, om, and pm to quantify selected transport parameters. application of the model to residences in the u.s. midwest indicates that as in ambient air can account for nearly 60% of the as input to floor dust with soil track-in representing the remainder. historic data on pb contamination in sacramento, ca, were used to reconstruct sources of pb in indoor dust showing that airborne pb was likely the dominant source in the early 1980s. however, as airborne pb levels declined due to the phase-out of leaded gasoline, soil resuspension and track-in eventually became the primary sources of pb in house dust.",california,california,1,,environment,model,both
children's blood lead and standardized test performance response as indicators of neurotoxicity in metropolitan new orleans elementary schools,"this study analyzes pre-katrina variation in aggregate student performance and children's blood lead (bpb) in 117 elementary school districts in metropolitan new orleans. fourth grade student achievement on louisiana educational assessment program (leap) tests were analyzed as a function of bpb for children 1-6 years old within school districts, controlling for student-teacher ratios, percent of students eligible for a free or discounted lunch, and school racial demography. measures of performance across subject areas (english language arts, science, mathematics, and social studies) include school achievement test scores (ats) and indices of agreement and variation in student achievement. ats are measured on a 5-point scale, corresponding to achievement categories of advanced = 5 to unsatisfactory = 1. regression results show that median bpb (mu g/dl) and percent of children with bpb > 10 mu g/dl are significantly associated with reductions in test scores across all subjects and depress variation in student performance across achievement categories. these data suggest that assisting children with improved school performance requires alleviation of pre-school pb exposure and its associated neurotoxic damage. cost-benefit calculations suggest that it is more cost effective to pay for onetime primary prevention instead of paying continuous expenses focused on reversing neurotoxic damage.

potential for atmospheric-driven lead paint degradation in the south coast air basin of california,"exposure to lead in paint or lead residues in house dust and soil is one of the leading environmental risks to the health of children in the united states. components of photochemical smog can increase the degradation of binders in lead paint, leading to increased release of lead pigment granules to hands in surface contact or for deposition in house dust and soil. this study uses photochemical air quality modeling to map areas susceptible to increased lead paint degradation as a result of photochemical atmospheric pollutants to prioritize areas of concern. typical air quality episodes in the south coast air basin of california (socab) are modeled for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. results indicate that large areas of the socab were susceptible to atmospheric-driven accelerated lead paint degradation. inner city urban areas from central los angeles to azusa and most of orange county had the highest susceptibility to accelerated lead paint degradation, followed by inland locations near the san bernardino mountains. this study identifies photochemical oxidant gases as contributors to greater lead release from indoor painted surfaces in urban areas.",california,california,1,,environment,environment,NA
rapid new methods for paint collection and lead extraction,"chronic exposure of children to lead can result in permanent physiological impairment. in adults, it can cause irritability, poor muscle coordination, and nerve damage to the sense organs and nerves controlling the body. surfaces coated with lead-containing paints are potential sources of exposure to lead. in april 2008, the u. s. environmental protection agency (epa) finalized new requirements that would reduce exposure to lead hazards created by renovation, repair, and painting activities, which disturb lead-based paint. on-site, inexpensive identification of lead-based paint is required. two steps have been taken to meet this challenge. first, this paper presents a new, highly efficient method for paint collection that is based on the use of a modified wood drill bit. second, this paper presents a novel, one-step approach for quantitatively grinding and extracting lead from paint samples for subsequent lead determination. this latter method is based on the use of a high-revolutions per minute rotor with stator to break up the paint into approximately 50 micron-size particles. nitric acid (25%, v/v) is used to extract the lead in <3 minutes. recoveries are consistently >95% for real-world paints, national institute of standards and technology's standard reference materials, and audit samples from the american industrial hygiene association's environmental lead proficiency analytical testing program. this quantitative extraction procedure, when paired with quantitative paint sample collection and lead determination, may enable the development of a lead paint test kit that will meet the specifications of the final epa rule.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
neurotoxic effects and biomarkers of lead exposure: a review,"lead, a systemic toxicant affecting virtually every organ system, primarily affects the central nervous system, particularly the developing brain. consequently, children are at a greater risk than adults of suffering from the neurotoxic effects of lead. to date, no safe lead-exposure threshold has been identified. the ability of lead to pass through the blood-brain barrier is due in large part to its ability to substitute for calcium ions. within the brain, lead-induced damage in the prefrontal cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum can lead to a variety of neurologic disorders. at the molecular level, lead interferes with the regulatory action of calcium on cell functions and disrupts many intracellular biological activities. experimental studies have also shown that lead exposure may have genotoxic effects, especially in the brain, bone marrow, liver, and lung cells. knowledge of the neurotoxicology of lead has advanced in recent decades due to new information on its toxic mechanisms and cellular specificity. this paper presents an overview, updated to january 2009, of the neurotoxic effects of lead with regard to children, adults, and experimental animals at both cellular and molecular levels, and discusses the biomarkers of lead exposure that are useful for risk assessment in the field of environmental health.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead dustfall from demolition of scattered site family housing: developing a sampling methodology,"background: over 3000 older homes containing lead-based paint are demolished in chicago each year. while previous studies investigating large multifamily housing demolitions have shown high levels of lead in dustfall, dispersed single-family housing demolition have yet to be assessed. presently, no standards exist to regulate the extent of lead dustfall from housing demolition. objectives: we studied ten residences in chicago undergoing demolition and debris removal and compared dustfall rates to five standing homes from march to october 2006. methods: dustfall was measured using a modification of apha method 502; samplers consisted of plastic buckets filled with 1l of deionized water, elevated to breathing zone height and placed around the demolition site perimeter. laboratory analysis consisted of filtration, acid digestion and analysis by icp/ms. results: during demolition, the geometric mean lead dustfall (n = 43 at 10 locations) was 64.1 mu g pb/m(2)/h (range: 1.3-3902.5), while the geometric mean lead dustfall for areas with no demolition (n = 18 at 6 locations) was 12.9 mu g pb/m(2)/h (range: 1.8-54.5). this difference was highly statistically significant (p = 0.0004). when dust suppression measures were used, dustfall lead levels were lower, although the difference was not statistically significant. the geometric mean lead dustfall with dust suppression (n = 25 at five locations) and without (n = 22 at six locations) was 48 pb mu g/m(2)/h and 74.6 mu g pb/m(2)/h, respectively. conclusion: demolition dustfall lead levels are much higher than background levels of lead during demolition of single-family housing and may constitute a yet uncharacterized but important source of lead exposure to nearby residents. simple dust suppression methods are likely to reduce the contamination considerably.

"lead toxicity, vulnerable subpopulations and emergency preparedness","this paper reviews some evidence of the toxic effects of lead (pb) in the context of vulnerable subpopulations and emergency preparedness. pb is ubiquitous in the environment and is used in many building materials. environmental pb concentrations and body burdens of pb have been shown to increase following disasters. pb is a systemic toxicant with no known beneficial biological function and, for several endpoints, no identified threshold of toxicity. the fetus, children, pregnant and elderly are particularly susceptible to some of the toxic effects of pb. pb exposures in infancy have been shown in vivo to produce an equal degree of neurobehavioural impairment as exposures of much longer duration at equivalent doses during adolescence. evidence from animal bioassays indicates that the carcinogenic potency of perinatal pb exposure may be about 3-fold higher than adult lifetime exposure at an equivalent dose. animal assays show up to a 12-fold difference between fetal, neonatal and adult life stages in sensitivity to the immunological effects of pb. pb exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality-health endpoints for which the elderly are at increased risk. finally, endogenous and exogenous variables, such as psychological and physiological stress, dietary deficiencies and concomitant exposure to other chemical, biological and radiological hazards, can also potentially modify or potentiate the toxic effects of pb. because of the potential for concurrent influence of these modifying variables in a post-disaster environment, emergency response planners are encouraged to consider disaster victims and responders, as a whole, as a potentially vulnerable subpopulation.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk,"lead is a potent, pervasive neurotoxicant, and elevated blood lead levels (eblls) can result in decreased iq, academic failure, and behavioral problems in children. eliminating eblls among children is one of the 2010 u.s. national health objectives. data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) indicate substantial decreases both in the percentage of persons in the united states with eblls and in mean blls among all age and ethnic groups, including children aged 1--5 years. historically, children in low-income families served by public assistance programs have been considered to be at greater risk for eblls than other children. however, evidence indicates that children in low-income families are experiencing decreases in blls, suggesting that the ebll disparity between medicaid-eligible children and non--medicaid-eligible children is diminishing. in response to these findings, the cdc advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention is updating recommendations for blood lead screening among children eligible for medicaid by providing recommendations for improving bll screening and information for health-care providers, state officials, and others interested in lead-related services for medicaid-eligible children. because state and local officials are more familiar than federal agencies with local risk for eblls, cdc recommends that these officials have the flexibility to develop blood lead screening strategies that reflect local risk for eblls. rather than provide universal screening to all medicaid children, which was previously recommended, state and local officials should target screening toward specific groups of children in their area at higher risk for eblls. this report presents the updated cdc recommendations and provides strategies to 1) improve screening rates of children at risk for eblls, 2) develop surveillance strategies that are not solely dependent on bll testing, and 3) assist states with evaluation of screening plans.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
blood lead (pb) levels: further evidence for an environmental mechanism explaining the association between socioeconomic status and psychophysiological dysregulation in children,"objective: the authors recently reported that blood lead (pb) was a significant mediator for the positive association between socioeconomic status (ses) and peripheral vascular responses to acute stress in children (b. b. gump et al., 2007). the present study considers the possibility that pb may also mediate an association between ses and cortisol responses to acute stress. design: early childhood pb exposure was tested as a mediator for cross-sectional associations between ses and cortisol responses. main outcome measures: the primary outcome was cortisol responses to acute stress in 9.5-year-old children (n = 108). results: lower family income was associated with significantly greater cortisol levels following an acute stress task. a mediational analysis confirmed that pb was a significant mediator for this association. conclusion: these results reaffirm the importance of considering the chemical environment as well as social and psychological environment when evaluating psychophysiological effects of low ses.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the social costs of childhood lead exposure in the post-lead regulation era,"objective: to estimate the benefits that might be realized if all children in the united states had a blood lead level of less than 1 mu g/dl. design: data were obtained from published and electronic sources. a markov model was used to project lifetime earnings, reduced crime costs, improvements in health, and reduced welfare costs using 2 scenarios: (1) maintaining the status quo and (2) reducing the blood lead level of all children to less than 1 mu g/dl. participants: the cohort of us children between birth and age 6 years in 2008, with economic and health outcomes projected for 65 years. interventions: increased primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing lead exposure among children and pregnant women. main outcome measures: societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (qalys) gained. results: reducing blood lead levels to less than 1 mu g/dl among all us children between birth and age 6 years would reduce crime and increase on-time high school graduation rates later in life. the net societal benefits arising from these improvements in high school graduation rates and reductions in crime would amount to $50 000 (sd, $14 000) per child annually at a discount rate of 3%. this would result in overall savings of approximately $1.2 trillion (sd,$341 billion) and produce an additional 4.8 million qalys (sd, 2 million qalys) for us society as a whole. conclusion: more aggressive programs aimed at reducing childhood lead exposure may produce large social benefits.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the relation of lead neurotoxicity to the event-related potential p3b component in inuit children from arctic quebec,"the event-related potential (erp) p3b, a cognitive electrophysiological measure that has been linked to working memory processing in many experimental paradigms, was measured in inuit children from nunavik (arctic quebec, canada) to assess lead (pb) neurotoxicity. visual and auditory oddball paradigms were administered at 5 (n = 27) and i i (n = 110) years of age, respectively, to elicit this erp component. pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between pb levels and p3b parameters (peak latency and amplitude). greater prenatal pb exposure was related to a decrease in p3b amplitude at 5 years of age, and early childhood pb exposure was associated with delayed p3b latency at 5 years. no significant association was observed at 11 years. these results, in line with those from previous neurobehavioral studies, suggest that pb exposure affects cognitive processing in children even though the pb levels measured in a large majority of our sample were below the threshold value for public health intervention used by federal agencies. this study strengthens the arguments for reducing sources of pb exposure in nunavik and for lowering the blood pb concentrations considered """"acceptable"""" in governmental policies.

higher infant blood lead levels with longer duration of breastfeeding,"objective: to determine whether longer breastfeeding is associated with higher infant lead concentrations. study design: data were analyzed from 3 studies of developmental effects of iron deficiency in infancy: costa rica (1981-1984), chile (1991-1996), and detroit (2002-2003). the relation between duration of breastfeeding and lead levels was assessed with pearson product-moment or partial correlation coefficients. results: more than 93% of the costa rica and chile samples was breastfed (179 and 323 breastfed infants, respectively; mean weaning age, 8-10 months), as was 35.6% of the detroit sample (53 breastfed infants; mean weaning age, 4.5 months). lead concentrations averaged 10.8 microg/dl (costa rica, 12-23 months), 7.8 microg/dl (chile, 12 months), and 2.5 microg/dl (detroit, 9-10 months). duration of breastfeeding as sole milk source and total breastfeeding correlated with lead concentration in all samples (r values = 0.14-0.57; p values = .06-<.0001). conclusions: longer breastfeeding was associated with higher infant lead concentration in 3 countries, in 3 different decades, in settings differing in breastfeeding patterns, environmental lead sources, and infant lead levels. the results suggest that monitoring lead concentrations in breastfed infants be considered.",nongeographical,michigan,0,Detroit (among Chile and Costa Rica),maternity,nutrition,NA
comparing lead poisoning risk assessment methods: census block group characteristics vs. zip codes as predictors,"objective. we determined which children should be tested for elevated blood lead levels (blls) in the face of financial and practical barriers to universal screening efforts and within 2009 centers for disease control and prevention recommendations allowing health departments to develop bll screening strategies. methods. we used the michigan database of bll tests from 1998 through 2005, which contains address, medicaid eligibility, and race data. linking addresses to u.s. census 2000 data by block group provided neighborhood sociodemographic and housing characteristics. to derive an equation predicting bll, we treated bll as a continuous variable and used hierarchical linear modeling to estimate the prediction equation. results. census block groups explained more variance in bll than tracts and much more than dichotomized zip code risk (which is current pediatric practice). housing built before 1940, socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic characteristics of the block group, child characteristics, and empirical bayesian residuals explained more than 41% of the variance in bll during 1998-2001. by contrast, zip code risk and medicaid status only explained 15% of the bll variance. an equation using 1998-2001 bll data predicted well for bll tests performed in 2002-2005. while those who received bll tests had above-average risk, this method produced minimal bias in using the prediction equation for all children. conclusions. our equation offers better specificity and sensitivity than using dichotomized zip codes and medicaid status, thereby identifying more high-risk children while also offering substantial cost savings. our prediction equation can be used with a simple internet-based program that allows health-care providers to enter minimal information and determine whether a bll test is recommended.",michigan,michigan,1,,screening,sociodemographic,NA
"spatial analysis of bioavailable soil lead concentrations in los angeles, california","lead (pb) poisoning causes permanent neurologic and developmental disorders and remains an important environmental health problem for us children, despite removal of pb from gasoline and household paints. to better understand the contribution of pb from historical traffic and residential pb based paint to soil pb concentrations in los angeles, we analyzed 550 soil pb samples from south central los angeles county, ca, in relation to land-use patterns (commercial, industrial, residential, and parks and open areas) and proximity to freeways, highways, and major arterials. house age variables (surrogates of historical pb-based paint) and traffic index variables (surrogates of historical traffic) were created at different buffer distances (10-5000 m). total and bioavailable pb concentrations near freeways and major arterials were significantly higher than those collected elsewhere. total and bioavailable pb concentrations were highly correlated (r=0.96) after the removal of one outlier. both parcel-age related variables and traffic variables were important predictors of current soil bioavailable pb concentrations. average age of parcels within 30 m and length of small streets within 3000 m explained 57% and 38% of the variance, respectively, in soil bioavailable pb concentrations in residential areas away from freeways and major arterials (n=44). road length of freeways within 750 m explained 28% of bioavailable pi) concentrations in parks and open areas (n=26). multi-variable regression models predicted 16-61% of the variances in bioavailable pb concentrations, depending on land-use type and spatial relationship to roadways. based on these models a map of spatial distributions of soil pb concentrations was created for the los angeles area that shows promise as a screening tool to evaluate continued pb poisoning in children.

blood lead screening among newly arrived refugees in minnesota,"during the last 10 years, the prevalence rate of elevated blood lead levels (eblls) in the general population in the united states has decreased, while the rate of eblls among refugee children in this country has remained high. because of this, national guidelines recommend both an initial and a repeat screening of refugee children. to explore blood lead screening among refugee children in minnesota, we examined data on 1,256 children who arrived in minnesota between 2004 and 2007. our objectives were to describe the characteristics of refugee children who are screened for blood lead; identify the characteristics of refugee children with an ebll following screening; and describe the characteristics of refugee children who received a repeat blood lead test. our results showed that approximately 6% of refugee children in minnesota had an ebll and fewer than half of all refugee children in the sample received a repeat test. for that reason, primary care providers should be periodically reminded of the importance of repeat lead screening for refugee children.",minnesota,minnesota,1,,screening,refugee/immigrant,NA
lead distributions and risks in new orleans following hurricanes katrina and rita,"during the last four years, significant effort has been devoted to understanding the effects that hurricanes katrina and rita had on contaminant distribution and redistribution in new orleans, louisiana, usa, and the surrounding gulf coast area. elevated concentrations were found for inorganic contaminants (including as, fe, pb, and v), several organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and volatiles) and high concentration of bioaerosols, particularly aeromonas and vibrio. data from different research groups confirm that some contaminant concentrations are elevated, that existing concentrations are similar to historical data, and that contaminants such as ph and as may pose human health risks. two data sets have been compiled in this article to serve as the foundation for preliminary risk assessments within greater new orleans. research from the present study suggests that children in highly contaminated areas of new orleans may experience pb exposure from soil ranging from 1.37 mu g/d to 102 mu g/d. these data are critical in the evaluation of children's health. environ. toxicol. chem. 2010;29:1429-1437.

barriers to pediatric lead screening: implications from a web-based survey of vermont pediatricians,"the pernicious effects of lead on child health are well documented. the vermont department of health (vdh) recommends screening all 12- and 24-month-old children for elevated blood lead levels (bll). in 2006, only 41.4% of 24-month-old vermont children were screened. to identify barriers preventing pediatricians from performing blood lead screening, a survey was distributed to vermont primary care pediatricians-divided in higher and lower screening groups. vermont pediatricians were more likely to be lower screeners if they reported negative health outcomes began at bll > 10 mu g/dl (odds ratio [or] = 3.64, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.12-11.99), practiced in chittenden county (or = 3.34, 95% ci = 1.14-9.78), or disagreed with the vdh's recommendation (or = 4.90, 95% ci = 1.66-15.50). adjusted analysis indicated the most significant determinants of lower screening rates were male gender, a perceived dangerous bll as > 10 mu g/dl and low self-reported medicaid population. the vdh may have an opportunity to increase bll screening emphasizing the significant health risks associated with bll = 10 mu g/dl.",vermont,vermont,1,,screening,screening,NA
community- and family-level factors influence care-giver choice to screen blood lead levels of children in a mining community,"context: bunker hill, in kellogg, idaho, formerly a lead mine (1884-1981) and smelter (1917-1981), is now a superfund site listed on the environmental protection agency's (epa) national priorities list. lead contamination from the site is widespread due to past smelter discharges to land, water, and air, placing children at risk for both exposure to lead and resultant health effects of lead. since 1983, the epa has used child blood lead levels to inform the clean-up standards for the bunker hill superfund site. this study was undertaken to examine factors that have contributed to the significant fall-off in the rates and numbers of children being screened for blood lead in kellogg (number screened decreased from 195 to 8 from 2002 to 2007). the goal of this research project was to define community- and family-level factors which influence care-giver choice to screen blood lead levels of their children in this environment. methods: this formative research study used mixed methods and was comprised of three research components: (1) preliminary interviews using community-based participatory research methods to define key research questions of relevance to community members, government and ngos working in relation to the bunker hill clean-up; (2) a quantitative analysis of a cross-sectional household survey conducted with adult care-givers about child blood lead screening in kellogg; and (3) ethnographic community rapid assessment methods formed the in-depth interview process and qualitative analysis. results: the survey showed the likelihood of blood lead screening that for children under the age of 18 years increases 34% with each one-year increase in current age of the child (95% ci, 1.08-1.67, p-value=0.009), and decreases 45% with annual household income greater than $10,000 (95% ci, 0.35-0.88, p-value=0.013). sibling birth order increased the likelihood of blood lead screening by 61% (95% ci, 1.04-2.48, p-value=0.032) for each successive child. female children were rated by their care-givers as 3.7 times less agitated or easily angered than male children (95% ci, 1.5-8.8, p-value=0.005). across all levels of interviews, regulators, residents, and non-governmental organization representatives reported that kellogg's long history as a mining town has continued to influence attitudes and actions of care-givers to access blood lead screening for their children. the mining context has been described as instilling stigmas, parental blame and a sense of shame about lead exposure and resultant health effects. discussion: children under 6 years of age are currently the least likely to have been screened for lead in kellogg and screening rates decreased in the 2000s. according to most indicators, socio-economic status did not influence the likelihood of a care-giver to screen children's blood lead levels. however, children in homes with an annual income below $10,000 were more likely to have been screened than the rest of the population. former concerted screening efforts, including outreach, support, follow-up, and financial incentives in the 1980s-1990s to screen children, may have influenced low-income residents. programmatic outreach for children under 6 years of age in kellogg should focus on increasing female child and first child blood lead screening, rather than targeting only low-income families, by improving approaches to promotion, implementation and environmental follow-up for child lead screening. some families have resided in kellogg for five to six generations, and the long-term mining context influences community values and perceptions of lead exposure and screening for children through a conflicted combination of pride in the mining history, attachment to the past economy that supported the community in juxtaposition to the personalized blame, shame, guilt, and stigma associated with children having high blood lead levels. health communication and other programs should prioritize methods of reducing parental feelings of blame, shame and guilt, and stigmas associated with the health effects of lead in a way that respects the pride of former mine workers, their families, and the history of the town.",idaho,idaho,1,,environment,screening,NA

evaluating and regulating lead in synthetic turf,"background: in 2007, a synthetic turf recreational field in newark, new jersey, was closed because lead was found in synthetic turf fibers and in surface dust at concentrations exceeding hazard criteria. consequently, public health professionals across the country began testing synthetic turf to determine whether it represented a lead hazard. currently, no standardized methods exist to test for lead in synthetic turf or to assess lead hazards. objectives: our objectives were to increase awareness of potential lead exposure from synthetic turf by presenting data showing elevated lead in fibers and turf-derived dust; identify risk assessment uncertainties; recommend that federal and/or state agencies determine appropriate methodologies for assessing lead in synthetic turf; and recommend an interim standardized approach for sampling, interpreting results, and taking health-protective actions. discussion: data collected from recreational fields and child care centers indicate lead in synthetic turf fibers and dust at concentrations exceeding the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 statutory lead limit of 300 mg/kg for consumer products intended for use by children, and the u.s. environmental protection agency's lead-dust hazard standard of 40 mu g/ft(2) for floors. conclusions: synthetic turf can deteriorate to form dust containing lead at levels that may pose a risk to children. given elevated lead levels in turf and dust on recreational fields and in child care settings, it is imperative that a consistent, nationwide approach for sampling, assessment, and action be developed. in the absence of a standardized approach, we offer an interim approach to assess potential lead hazards when evaluating synthetic turf.",new jersey,new jersey,1,,environment,school,outdoor

the relation of environmental contaminants exposure to behavioral indicators in inuit preschoolers in arctic quebec,"although lead (pb) exposure has been identified as an important risk factor in child behavioral development, less is known regarding the relation between child behavior and exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) and mercury (hg). inuit children are particularly exposed to these chemicals and the aim of this study was to investigate the association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to pb, pcbs, hg and several aspects of behavioral function in inuit preschoolers. the sample consisted of one hundred and ten 5-year-old inuit children from arctic quebec. an umbilical cord blood sample was used to document prenatal exposure to pb, pcbs and hg. child blood samples were collected at age 5 and the same contaminants were measured. a modified version of the infant behavior rating scale from the bayley scales of infant development-ii was used to assess child behavior through examiners' ratings. furthermore, attention, activity and emotional outcomes were assessed through behavioral coding of video recordings taken during fine motor testing. pb exposure during childhood was associated with examiners ratings of greater impulsivity, irritability and with coding of observed inattention. prenatal exposure to pcb 153 correlated with the examiners ratings of increased state of unhappiness and anxiety during the testing session, which was corroborated from video coding since cord pcb 153 was related to fewer manifestations of positive affects. no association was found with hg exposure. these data corroborated those from previous pb cohort studies and revealed an association between prenatal pcbs exposure and emotional outcomes in preschoolers.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
spatial patterns and health disparities in pediatric lead exposure in chicago: characteristics and profiles of high-risk neighborhoods,"lead poisoning remains a major environmental health threat and a persistent source of health disparities in the united states. in this retrospective study, statistical and geospatial approaches were used to evaluate age- and gender-specific differences in childhood lead prevalence across chicago, assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease, and identify the socioeconomic and racial composition of high-risk communities. elevated blood lead levels (≥ 10 ... g/dl of lead) decreased significantly during the study period but disparities persisted across neighborhoods. a significant association was observed between high-risk neighborhoods and housing age, low income, and minority populations. these findings provide insights into the complex geographies of lead exposure and could serve as a basis for developing more targeted health intervention programs.

research needs for community-based risk assessment: findings from a multi-disciplinary workshop,"communities face exposures to multiple environmental toxicants and other non-chemical stressors. in addition, communities have unique activities and norms that influence exposure and vulnerability. yet, few studies quantitatively consider the role of cumulative exposure and additive impacts. community-based risk assessment (cbra) is a new approach for risk assessment that aims to address the cumulative stressors faced by a particular community, while incorporating a community-based participatory research framework. this paper summarizes an environmental protection agency (epa) sponsored workshop, """"research needs for community-based risk assessment."""" this workshop brought together environmental and public health scientists and practitioners for fostering an innovative discussion about tools, methods, models, and approaches for cbra. this workshop was organized around three topics: (1) data and measurement methods; (2) the biological impact of non-chemical stressors and interaction with environmental exposures; and (3) statistical and mathematical modeling. this report summarizes the workshop discussions, presents identified research needs, and explores future research opportunities in this emerging field. journal of exposure science and environmental epidemiology (2010) 20, 186-195; doi: 10.1038/jes.2009.8; published online 25 february 2009",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
pediatric lead exposure from imported indian spices and cultural powders,"background: significant lead poisoning has been associated with imported nonpaint products. objectives: to describe cases of pediatric lead intoxication from imported indian spices and cultural powders, determine lead concentrations in these products, and predict effects of ingestion on pediatric blood lead levels (blls). patients and methods: cases and case-study information were obtained from patients followed by the pediatric environmental health center (children's hospital boston). imported spices (n = 86) and cultural powders (n = 71) were analyzed for lead by using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. the simple bioaccessibility extraction test was used to estimate oral bioavailability. the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children was used to predict population-wide geometric mean blls and the probability of elevated blls (>10 mu g/dl). results: four cases of pediatric lead poisoning from indian spices or cultural powders are described. twenty-two of 86 spices and foodstuff products contained >1 mu g/g lead (for these 22 samples, mean: 2.6 mu g/g [95% confidence interval: 1.9-3.3]; maximum: 7.6 mu g/g). forty-six of 71 cultural products contained >1 mu g/g lead (for 43 of these samples, mean: 8.0 mu g/g [95% confidence interval: 5.2-10.8]; maximum: 41.4 mu g/g). three sindoor products contained >47% lead. with a fixed ingestion of 5 mu g/day and 50% bioavailability, predicted geometric mean blls for children aged 0 to 4 years increased from 3.2 to 4.1 mu g/dl, and predicted prevalence of children with a bll of >10 mu g/dl increased more than threefold (0.8%-2.8%). conclusions: chronic exposure to spices and cultural powders may cause elevated blls. a majority of cultural products contained >1 mu g/g lead, and some sindoor contained extremely high bioaccessible lead levels. clinicians should routinely screen for exposure to these products. pediatrics 2010; 125: e828-e835",nongeographical,massachusetts,0,Boston,nutrition,diet,NA
blood lead levels among pregnant women: historical versus contemporaneous exposures,"blood lead among pregnant women, even at modest levels, may impair offspring cognitive development. we examine whether blood lead levels (blls) result from current versus historic exposures, among a cohort of pregnant women. cumulative logit models were used to characterize the relationship between maternal risk factors and higher blls. maternal blood lead levels more likely result from lead remobilization from historic versus contemporaneous exposures. even if all lead sources were abated immediately, women and their fetuses would experience lead exposure for decades. this work emphasizes the importance of addressing sources of environmental lead exposure in the united states and internationally.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
source and occurrence of particulate lead in tap water,"lead samples were collected at the tap from homes with lead service lines (lsls) in a full-scale utility using both random daytime (rdt) and particulate stimulation sampling (pss) protocols. analysis of the results revealed two sources and occurrences of particulate lead. a first source is due to corrosion of lead-bearing elements in the premise plumbing (pp) and occurs mostly at low to moderate concentrations <3 mu g/l, with some sporadic higher concentrations (4-12 mu g/l). these spikes were consistently observed and considerably increased using pss, showing that current sampling protocols may miss a significant portion of particulate lead. the second source results from the adsorption of dissolved lead onto iron deposits in lsl/pp, and is continuously present at low to moderate concentrations. statistical analyses were validated by physical analyses of: (i) lead scales from lsls; and (ii) lead particles from tap aerators.

new orleans before and after hurricanes katrina/rita: a quasi-experiment of the association between soil lead and children's blood lead,"prior to hurricanes katrina and rita (hkr), significant associations were noted between soil lead (sl) and blood lead (bl) in new orleans. engineering failure of new orleans levees and canal walls after hkr set the stage for a quasi-experiment to evaluate bl responses by 13 306 children to reductions in sl. high density soil surveying conducted in 46 census tracts before hkr was repeated after the flood. paired t test results show that sl decreased from 328.54 to 203.33 mg/kg post-hkr (t = 3.296, p < or = 0.01). decreases in sl are associated with declines in children's bl response (r = 0.308, p < or = 0.05). when sl decreased at least 1%, median children's bl declined 1.55 microg/dl. declines in median bl are largest in census tracts with > or =50% decrease in sl. also individual bl in children was predicted as a function of sl, adjusting for age, year of observation, and depth of flood waters. at the individual scale, bl decreased significantly in post-hkr as a function of sl, with bl decreases ranging from b = -1.20 to -1.65 microg/dl, depending on the decline of sl and whether children were born in the post-hkr period. our results support policy to improve soil conditions for children.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,environment,outdoor
lead and bisphenol a concentrations in the canadian population,"background lead is a known toxicant that occurs naturally in the environment. bisphenol a (bpa) is an industrial chemical used primarily in polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. it has been 30 years since lead exposure was measured at a national level, and it is the first time for a national assessment of bpa exposure. data and methods data are from the 2007-2009 canadian health measure survey. lead in whole blood (pbb) and urinary bpa were measured in 5,319 and 5,476 respondents aged 6 to 79, respectively. geometric means (gms) are presented by age group and sex for pbb (mu g/dl), volume-based bpa (mu g/l), and creatinine-standardized bpa (mu g/g creatinine). adjusted least squares geometric means (lsgms) for pbb and bpa are presented by selected covariates. results pbb was detected in 100% of the population, with a gm concentration of 1.34 mu g/dl. adults aged 60 to 79 and males had significantly higher gm pbb concentrations. lower household income, being born outside canada, living in a dwelling at least 50 years old, current or former smoking, and drinking alcohol at least once a week were associated with higher pbb concentrations. urinary bpa was detected in 91% of the population, with a gm concentration of 1.16 mu g/l (1.40 mu g/g creatinine). children aged 6 to 11 had significantly higher gm creatinine-standardized bpa concentrations than did other age groups. interpretation although pbb concentrations have declined dramatically since the 1970s, socio-demographic characteristics, the age of dwellings, and certain lifestyle behaviours are associated with higher levels. given the short half-life of orally ingested bpa and the high frequency of detection, the chms data suggest continual widespread exposure in the canadian population.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
childhood lead exposure and uptake in teeth in the cleveland area during the era of leaded gasoline,"childhood uptake of lead from exposure to atmospheric leaded gasoline in the united states has been studied using mainly blood lead levels. since reliable blood lead techniques were used only after the peak use of leaded gasoline, the prior exposure history is unclear. the well-documented decline in blood lead levels after the mid-1970s could represent the continuation of a historic steady decline in exposure from many sources. alternatively, the post-1970s decline might represent the declining phase of a unimodal rise and fall corresponding closely to usage of leaded gasoline. to assess these possibilities, lead concentration and super(207)pb/ super(206)pb isotope ratios were measured in the enamel of permanent molar teeth formed between 1936 and 1993 in mainly african-american donors who grew up in the cleveland area. tooth enamel preserves the lead concentration and isotope ratio that prevails during tooth formation. historical trends in enamel lead concentration were significantly correlated with surrogates of atmospheric lead exposure: lead in sediments of two dated lake erie cores, and lead consumed in gasoline. about two-thirds of the total lead uptake into enamel in this period was attributable to leaded gasoline, and the remainder to other sources (e.g. paint). enamel super(207)pb/ super(206)pb isotope ratios were similar to those of one lake sediment. multivariate analysis revealed significant correlation in neighborhoods with higher levels of traffic, and including lake sediment data, accounted for 53% of the variation in enamel lead levels. enamel lead concentration was highly correlated with reported african-american childhood blood levels. the extrapolated peak level of 48 mu g/dl (range 40 to 63) is associated with clinical and behavioral impairments, which may have implications for adults who were children during the peak gasoline lead exposure. in sum, leaded gasoline emission was the predominant source of lead exposure of african-american cleveland children during the latter two-thirds of the 20th century.",nongeographical,ohio,0,Cleveland,biology,biomarker,NA
metal exposures in an inner-city neonatal population,"objectives: we measured concentrations of lead (pb), manganese (mn), chromium (cr), and copper (cu) in umbilical cord whole blood and examined sources of environmental pb exposures in a predominantly african-american population. methods: between april and july 2006, we collected reproductive histories, questionnaires, and blood samples from 102 women, aged 16-45 years, who delivered at a memphis, tn hospital. results: the prevalence of preeclampsia and low birth weight infancy in the study population was 11% and 10%, respectively. twenty-eight percent of mothers reported living near a potential pb-contaminated area, while 43% lived in a residence built before 1978. geometric mean (gm) concentrations for umbilical cord blood in the study population were 1.3, 3.5, 9.0, and 52.0 microg/dl for pb, mn, cr, and cu, respectively. six neonates had cord blood pb (cbl) concentrations above 10 microg/dl, while 20 had cbl concentrations > or =2 microg/dl. gm umbilical cbl levels were higher in neonates born to women living near a potential pb-contaminated area (2.2 vs. 1.1 microg/dl) and those with friends, family or household members exposed to lead products (1.6 vs. 1.1 microg/dl). some evidence of an exposure-response relationship was also detected between all four metal concentrations and an increasing number of maternal lead exposures. after adjustment for confounding, proximity to a pb-contaminated area was the strongest environmental determinant of cbl levels among neonates with cbl concentrations of > or =2 microg/dl (odds ratio=5.1; 95% ci=1.6, 16.7). conclusions: metal concentrations were elevated in this population, and cbl levels were associated with proximity to pb-contaminated areas.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
developmental neurotoxicants in e-waste: an emerging health concern,"electronic waste (e-waste) has been an emerging environmental health issue in both developed and developing countries, but its current management practice may result in unintended developmental neurotoxicity in vulnerable populations. to provide updated information about the scope of the issue, presence of known and suspected neurotoxicants, toxicologic mechanisms, and current data gaps, we conducted this literature review. we reviewed original articles and review papers in pubmed and web of science regarding e-waste toxicants and their potential developmental neurotoxicity. we also searched published reports of intergovernmental and governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations on e-waste production and management practice. we focused on the potential exposure to e-waste toxicants in vulnerable populations-that is, pregnant women and developing children-and neurodevelopmental outcomes. in addition, we summarize experimental evidence of developmental neurotoxicity and mechanisms. in developing countries where most informal and primitive e-waste recycling occurs, environmental exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is prevalent at high concentrations in pregnant women and young children. developmental neurotoxicity is a serious concern in these regions, but human studies of adverse effects and potential mechanisms are scarce. the unprecedented mixture of exposure to heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants warrants further studies and necessitates effective pollution control measures. pregnant women and young children living close to informal e-waste recycling sites are at risk of possible perturbations of fetus and child neurodevelopment.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

practical guidelines for evaluating lead exposure in children with mental health conditions: molecular effects and clinical implications,"children in the united states are exhibiting extremely high levels of attentional and learning disabilities. although lead has been eliminated from many industrial products, children continue to come into contact with it, such as in toys and cosmetics. lead exposure occurs most commonly in poor, urban populations, and can exacerbate psychiatric disorders associated with stress. we present 1) an overview of lead exposure; 2) a detailed summary of current research on the molecular synergy of toxicity caused by lead and stress; 3) a review of human studies that appear to correlate with these molecular findings, including understanding nutrition, environmental enrichment, and caregiving as risk modifiers; and 4) a systematic approach for mental health practitioners in managing children presenting with multiple symptoms and risk factors for mental health conditions. in this article, we review some of the clinical and scientific challenges that relate to the assessment and treatment of children presenting for mental health care who may have potential lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
bioaccessibility of pb from ammunition in game meat is affected by cooking treatment,"background: the presence of lead (pb) ammunition residues in game meat has been widely documented, yet little information exists regarding the bioaccessibility of this pb contamination. we study how cooking treatment (recipe) can affect pb bioaccessibility in meat of animals hunted with pb ammunition. methodology/principal findings: we used an in vitro gastrointestinal simulation to study bioaccessibility. the simulation was applied to meat from red-legged partridge (alectoris rufa) hunted with pb shot pellets and cooked using various traditional spanish game recipes involving wine or vinegar. total pb concentrations in the meat were higher in samples with visible pb ammunition by x-ray (mean±se: 3.29±1.12 µg/g w.w.) than in samples without this evidence (1.28±0.61 µg/g). the percentage of pb that was bioaccessible within the simulated intestine phase was far higher in meat cooked with vinegar (6.75%) and wine (4.51%) than in uncooked meat (0.7%). risk assessment simulations using our results transformed to bioavailability and the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model (ieubk; us epa) show that the use of wine instead of vinegar in cooking recipes may reduce the percentage of children that would be expected to have >10 µg/dl of pb in blood from 2.08% to 0.26% when game meat represents 50% of the meat in diet. conclusions/significance: lead from ammunition in game meat is more bioaccessible after cooking, especially when using highly acidic recipes. these results are important because existing theoretical models regarding pb uptake and subsequent risk in humans should take such factors into account.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
estimation of leaded (pb) gasoline's continuing material and health impacts on 90 us urbanized areas,"the subject of this paper is lead (pb) additives in gasoline and their material and health impact from pb dust inputs into 90 us urbanized areas (uas). the mass of pb additives for 90 uas as a total of the us pb additives in 1982 were estimated from vehicle travel, vehicle fuel economy (miles/gallon), ratio of leaded to unleaded fuel, and pb/gallon. about 500billion (10¹) miles of travel in 90 ua's during 1982 account for ~18,000metric tons (mt), or nearly 30% of the us pb additives in 1982. applying the 1982 proportions to the 90 uas for 1950 through 1982 fuel sales by state accounts for ~1.4million mt pb of the us national total of 4.6million mt during the same years. fates of pb additives in engine systems were used to calculate pb aerosol inputs into the 90 uas. the inputs range from 100's to more than 100,000mt of pb depending on a given ua's traffic flow patterns. soils are the reservoir of urban pb dust. the median background soil pb for the us is 16.5mg/kg (range 10.3 to 30.1mg/kg), and less by an order of magnitude or more than soil pb within larger uas. recognizing the us input of massive gasoline pb additives into uas assists with comprehending soil pb differences between large and small uas, inner and outer areas of uas, health disparities, and school achievement issues within uas. the findings underscore the need for controlling accumulated exterior urban pb dust from gasoline additives along with paint sources that have accumulated in soil to meet the goal of primary childhood pb exposure prevention.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
effects of hud-supported lead hazard control interventions in housing on children's blood lead,"the evaluation of the us department of housing and urban development lead-based paint hazard control grant program studied the effectiveness of the housing intervention performed in reducing the blood lead of children at four post-intervention times (6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 3-years). a repeat measures analysis showed that blood lead levels declined up to three-years post-intervention. the results at each successive collection time were significantly lower than at the previous post-intervention time except for the difference between the levels at two and three years. at two-years post-intervention, geometric mean blood lead levels were approximately 37% lower than at pre-intervention. children with pre-intervention blood lead levels as low as 10 μg/dl experienced substantial declines in blood lead levels. previous studies have found substantial improvements only if a child's pre-intervention blood lead level was above 20 μg/dl. individual interior lead hazard control treatments as grouped by interior strategy were not a significant predictor of post-intervention blood lead levels. however, children living in dwellings where exterior lead hazard control interventions were done had lower blood lead levels at one-year post-intervention than those living in dwellings without the exterior interventions (all other factors being equal), but those differences were only significant when the mean exterior paint lead loading at pre-intervention was about the 90th percentile (7.0mg/cm(2)). this observation suggests that exterior lead hazard control can be an important component of a lead hazard control plan. children who were six to eleven months of age at pre-intervention had a significant increase in blood lead at one-year post-intervention, probably due to other exposures.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
impact of soil particle size and bioaccessibility on children and adult lead exposure in peri-urban contaminated soils,"the impact of soil particle size and bioaccessibility on children and adult lead (pb) exposure via the incidental soil ingestion pathway was assessed in 16 peri-urban contaminated soils. a comparison of pb distribution across 4 particle size fractions (<50 μm, <100 μm, <250 μm and <2 mm) found increasing pb concentrations associated with decreasing particle size fractions. lead enrichment in the <50 μm particle size fraction was up to 5 times the concentration observed in the bulk soil. when gastric phase pb bioaccessibility was determined in the <50, <100 and <250 μm particle size fractions using the sbrc assay, pb bioaccessibility also increased with decreasing particle size fraction for 6 of the 16 soils tested. assessment of children and adult pb exposure indicated that particle size and bioaccessibility had a significant influence on the contribution of incidental soil ingestion to daily pb intake values. although the <250 μm particle size fraction is recommended for incidental soil ingestion calculations, using this fraction has the potential to underestimate pb exposure due to the preferential adhesion of smaller particles to hands with elevated pb concentrations.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"a population-based assessment of the health of homeless families in new york city, 2001-2003","objectives: we compared estimated population-based health outcomes for new york city (nyc) homeless families with nyc residents overall and in low-income neighborhoods. methods: we matched a nyc family shelter user registry to mortality, tuberculosis, hiv/aids, and blood lead test registries maintained by the nyc department of health and mental hygiene (2001-2003). results: overall adult age-adjusted death rates were similar among the 3 populations. hiv/aids and substance-use deaths were 3 and 5 times higher for homeless adults than for the general population; only substance-use deaths were higher than for low-income adults. children who experienced homelessness appeared to be at an elevated risk of mortality (41.3 vs 22.5 per 100,000; p < .05). seven in 10 adult and child deaths occurred outside shelter. adult hiv/aids diagnosis rates were more than twice citywide rates but comparable with low-income rates, whereas tuberculosis rates were 3 times higher than in both populations. homeless children had lower blood lead testing rates and a higher proportion of lead levels over 10 micrograms per deciliter than did both comparison populations. conclusions: morbidity and mortality levels were comparable between homeless and low-income adults; homeless children's slightly higher risk on some measures possibly reflects the impact of poverty and poor-quality, unstable housing.",nongeographical,new york,0,New York City,sociodemographic,sociodemographic,NA

"nonlinear associations between blood lead in children, age of child, and quantity of soil lead in metropolitan new orleans","previous studies identified a curvilinear association between aggregated blood lead (bl) and soil lead (sl) data in new orleans census tracts. in this study we investigate the relationships between sl (mg/kg), age of child, and bl (μg/dl) of 55,551 children in 280 census tracts in metropolitan new orleans, 2000 to 2005. analyses include random effects regression models predicting bl levels of children (μg/dl) and random effects logistic regression models predicting the odds of bl in children exceeding 15, 10, 7, 5, and 3 μg/dl as a function of age and sl exposure. economic benefits of sl reduction scenarios are estimated. a unit raise in median sl⁰·⁵ significantly increases the bl level in children (b=0.214 p= or <0.01), and a unit change in age⁰·⁵ significantly increases child bl (b=0.401, p= or <0.01). a unit change in age⁰·⁵ increases the odds of a child bl exceeding 10 μg/dl by a multiplicative factor of 1.23 (95% ci 1.21 to 1.25), and a unit (mg/kg) addition of sl increases the odds of child bl> 10 μg/dl by a factor of 1.13 (95% ci 1.12 to 1.14). extrapolating from regression results, we find that a shift in sl regulatory standard from 400 to 100 mg/kg provides each child with an economic benefit ranging from $4710 to $12,624 ($us 2000). children's bl is a curvilinear function of both age and level of exposure to neighborhood sl. therefore, a change in sl regulatory standard from 400 to 100mg/kg provides children with substantial economic benefit.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,environment,outdoor
primary prevention of lead exposure: the philadelphia lead safe homes study,"objective: lead exposure in children can lead to neuropsychological impairment. this study tested whether primary prevention interventions in the newborn period prevent elevated blood lead levels (blls). methods: the philadelphia lead safe homes (lsh) study offered parental education, home evaluation, and lead remediation to the families of urban newborns. households were randomized to a standard lead education group or maintenance education group. we conducted home visits at baseline, six months, and 12 months. to compare blls, we identified a matched comparison group. results: we enrolled and randomized 314 newborns in the intervention component; 110 completed the study. there were few significant differences between the randomized groups. in the combined intervention groups, positive results on visual inspection declined from baseline to 12 months (97.0% to 90.6%, p = 0.007). at baseline, 36.9% of homes were above the u.s. environmental protection agency's lead dust standard, compared with 26.9% at 12 months (p = 0.032), mainly due to a drop in windowsill dust levels. both groups showed a significant increase in parental scores on a lead education test. children in the intervention and matched control groups had similar geometric mean initial blls (2.6 vs. 2.7, p = 0.477), but a significantly higher percentage of children in the intervention group had an initial blood lead screening compared with those in the matched group (88.9% vs. 84.4%, p = 0.032). conclusions: a study of primary prevention of lead exposure showed a higher blood lead screening rate for the combined intervention groups and mean blls at one year of age not statistically different from the comparison group. most homes had lead hazards. lead education significantly increased knowledge.",nongeographical,pennsylvania,0,Philadelphia,structure,education,indoor

metal sources and exposures in the homes of young children living near a mining-impacted superfund site,"children living near hazardous waste sites may be exposed to environmental contaminants, yet few studies have conducted multi-media exposure assessments, including residential environments where children spend most of their time. we sampled yard soil, house dust, and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter o2.5 in 59 homes of young children near an abandoned mining area and analyzed samples for lead (pb), zinc (zn), cadmium (cd), arsenic (as), and manganese (mn). in over half of the homes, dust concentrations of pb, zn, cd, and as were higher than those in soil. proximity to mine waste (chat) piles and the presence of chat in the driveway significantly predicted dust metals levels. homes with both chat sources had pb, zn, cd, and as dust levels two to three times higher than homes with no known chat sources after controlling for other sources. in contrast, mn concentrations in dust were consistently lower than in soil and were not associated with chat sources. mn dust concentrations were predicted by soil concentrations and occupant density. these findings suggest that nearby outdoor sources of metal contaminants from mine waste may migrate indoors. populations farther away from the mining site may also be exposed if secondary uses of chat are in close proximity to the home. journal of exposure science and environmental epidemiology (2011) 21, 495-505; doi: 10.1038/jes.2011.21; published online 18 may 2011",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

rochester's lead law: evaluation of a local environmental health policy innovation,"background: significant progress has been made in reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning in the united states in the past three decades. however, the prevalence of elevated blood lead in children >= 10 mu g/dl) remains high in some communities, particularly those with high proportions of pre-1978 housing in poor condition. increasingly, municipalities are using local policy tools to reduce lead poisoning in high-risk areas, but little is known about the effectiveness of such policies. objectives: in this article, we evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive rental housing-based lead law adopted in rochester, new york, in 2005. methods: this policy evaluation integrates analyses of city inspections data, a survey of landlords, landlord focus groups, and health department data on children's blood lead levels from the first 4 years of implementation of the 2005 law. results: implementation has proceeded consistent with projected numbers of inspections with nearly all target units inspected in the first 4 years. higher than expected inspection passage rates suggest that landlords have reduced lead hazards in rental housing affected by the law. implementation of the lead law does not appear to have had a significant impact on the housing market. conclusions: although many uncertainties remain, our analysis suggests that the lead law has had a positive impact on children's health. strong enforcement, support for community-based lead programs, and ongoing intergovernmental coordination will be necessary to maintain lead-safe housing in rochester. lessons learned from the rochester experience may inform future local lead poisoning prevention policies in other communities.",new york,new york,1,,policy,policy,NA
environmental lead after hurricane katrina: implications for future populations,"background: as a result of hurricane katrina, > 100,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and a significant amount of sediment was deposited throughout the city of new orleans, louisiana. researchers have identified the potential for increased lead hazards from environmental lead contamination of soils. objectives: we assessed the distribution of residential soil and dust lead 2 years poststorm and compared soil lead before and after the storm. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study in new orleans in which households were selected by stratified random sampling. a standard residential questionnaire was administered, and lead testing was performed for both the interior and exterior of homes. logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of interior and exterior lead levels in excess of allowable levels. results: one hundred nine households were enrolled; 61% had at least one lead measurement above federal standards. of homes with bare soil, 47% had elevated lead and 27% had levels exceeding 1,200 ppm. housing age was associated with soil lead, and housing age and soil lead were associated with interior lead. race, income, and ownership status were not significantly associated with either interior or exterior lead levels. the median soil lead level of 560 ppm was significantly higher than the median level of samples collected before hurricane katrina. conclusions: the high prevalence (61%) of lead above recommended levels in soil and dust samples in and around residences raises concern about potential health risks to the new orleans population, most notably children. steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of exposure to lead-contaminated soil and dust. further research is needed to quantify the possible contribution of reconstruction activities to environmental lead levels.",louisiana,louisiana,1,,environment,residential,both

lead in drinking water: sampling in primary schools and preschools in south central kansas,"studies in philadelphia, new york city, houston, washington, dc, and greenville, north carolina, have revealed high lead levels in drinking water. unlike urban areas, lead levels in drinking water in suburban and rural areas have not been adequately studied. in the study described in this article, drinking water in primary schools and preschools in five suburban and rural south central kansas towns was sampled to determine if any exceeded the u.s. environmental protection agency (u.s. epa) guidance level for schools and child care facilities of 20 parts per billion (ppb). the results showed a total of 32.1% of the samples had detectable lead levels and 3.6% exceeded the u.s. epa guidance level for schools and child care providers of 20 ppb. these results indicate that about one-third of the drinking water consumed by children age six and under in the five suburban and rural south central kansas towns studied has some lead contamination, exposing these children to both short-term and long-term health risks. the authors suggest a need for increased surveillance of children's drinking water in these facilities.

the effects of the urban built environment on the spatial distribution of lead in residential soils,"lead contamination of urban residential soils is a public health concern. consequently, there is a need to delineate hotspots in the landscape to identify risk and facilitate remediation. land use is a good predictor of some environmental pollutants. however, in the case of soil lead, research has shown that land use is not a useful proxy. we hypothesize that soil lead is related to both individual landscape features at the parcel scale and the landscape context in which parcels are embedded. we sampled soil lead on 61 residential parcels in baltimore, maryland using field-portable x-ray fluorescence. thirty percent of parcels had average lead concentrations that exceeded the usepa limit of 400 ppm and 53% had at least one reading that exceeded 400 ppm. results indicate that soil lead is strongly associated with housing age, distance to roadways, and on a parcel scale, distance to built structures.

"road dust lead (pb) in two neighborhoods of urban atlanta, (ga, usa)","road dust continues to be a major potential reservoir of pb in the urban environment, and an important potential component of child pb exposure. this study presents icp-aes analyses of metals in 72 samples of road dust (<250 mu m) collected in the urban core of atlanta, georgia. in the downtown area, median pb concentrations are similar to 63 mg/kg pb, with high values of 278 mg/kg. for comparison, median pb values in a nearby residential neighborhood (also in the urban core) were similar to 93 mg/kg, with a high of 972 mg/kg. geospatial variability is high, with significant variation observed over tens to hundreds of meters. spearman rank correlation tests suggest that pb and other metals (cu, ni, v, zn) are associated with iron and manganese oxide phases in the residential area, as reported in other cities. however, pb in the downtown area is not correlated with the others, suggesting a difference in source or transport history. given these complexities and the expected differences between road dust and soil pb, future efforts to assess exposure risk should therefore be based on spatially distributed sampling at very high spatial resolution.",georgia,georgia,1,,environment,environment,outdoor

"contribution of lead in soil to children's lead burden, an update","blood lead levels in children in the usa have dropped dramatically since lead in food, air and drinking water was reduced. in inner cities and older residential areas, increased lead exposure may still be a problem because of dilapidated housing with high lead paint levels. in these areas, at mining sites and around smelters lead levels in soil may be very high. a review of many studies indicates that lead in soil or mine tailings does not make a meaningful contribution to lead absorption by children. the contribution of lead in soil to overall exposure, if any, lies within the variation of the analytical method for blood lead measurements. the results of exposure studies in the pediatric population reviewed in this article do not support exposure predictions for children under 6 years of age based on the us epa integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model (using default parameters or using results obtained with in vitro digestion models). they also do not support predictions based on the percent of solubility of lead in soil (accessibility studies).",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead exposures from varnished floor refinishing,"we evaluated the presence of lead in varnish and factors predicting lead exposure from floor refinishing and inexpensive dust suppression control methods. lead in varnish, settled dust, and air were measured using xrf, laboratory analysis of scrape and wipe samples, and national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) method 7300, respectively, during refinishing (n = 35 homes). data were analyzed using step-wise logistic regression. compared with federal standards, no lead in varnish samples exceeded 1.0 mg/cm(2), but 52% exceeded 5000 ppm and 70% of settled dust samples after refinishing exceeded 40 mu g/ft(2). refinishing pre-1930 dwellings or stairs predicted high lead dust on floors. laboratory analysis of lead in varnish was significantly correlated with airborne lead (r = 0.23, p = 0.014). adding dust collection bags into drum sanders and hepa vacuums to edgers and buffers reduced mean floor lead dust by 8293 mu g pb/ft(2) (p<0.05) on floors and reduced most airborne lead exposures to less than 50 mu g/m(3). refinishing varnished surfaces in older housing produces high but controllable lead exposures.

window replacement and residential lead paint hazard control 12 years later,"window replacement is a key method of reducing childhood lead exposure, but the long-term effectiveness has not been previously evaluated. windows have the highest levels of interior lead paint and dust compared to other building components. our objective was to conduct a follow-up study of residential window replacement and lead hazard control 12 years after homes were enrolled in an evaluation of the hud lead hazard control grant program, sampling settled lead dust in housing in four cities (n=189 homes). previous work evaluated lead hazard controls up to 6 years after intervention using dust lead measurements and two years after intervention using both dust and blood lead data. but the earlier work could not examine the effect of window replacement over the longer time period examined here: 12 years. the individual homes were assigned to one of three categories, based on how many windows had been replaced: all replacement, some replacement, or non-replacement. windows that were not replaced were repaired. we controlled for covariates such as site, housing condition, presence of lead paint, and season using longitudinal regression modeling. adjusted floor and sill dust lead geometric mean dust lead loadings declined at least 85% from pre-intervention to 12 years after the intervention for homes with all replacement windows, some windows replaced and no windows replaced. twelve years after intervention, homes with all replacement windows had 41% lower interior floor dust lead, compared to non-replacement homes (1.4 versus 2.4 mu g/ft(2), p < 0.001), and window sill dust lead was 51% lower (25 versus 52 mu g/ft(2), p=0.006) while controlling for covariates. homes with some windows replaced had interior floor and window sill dust lead loadings that were 28% (1.7 versus 2.4 mu g/ft(2), p=0.19) and 37% (33 versus 52 mu g/ft(2), p=0.07) lower, respectively, compared to non-replacement homes. the net economic benefit of window replacement compared to window repair (non-replacement) is $1700-$2000 per housing unit. homes in which all windows were replaced had significantly lower lead dust. new windows are also likely to reduce energy use and improve home value. lead-safe window replacement is an important element of lead hazard control, weatherization, renovation and housing investment strategies and should be implemented broadly to protect children.

integrating susceptibility into environmental policy: an analysis of the national ambient air quality standard for lead,"susceptibility to chemical toxins has not been adequately addressed in risk assessment methodologies. as a result, environmental policies may fail to meet their fundamental goal of protecting the public from harm. this study examines how characterization of risk may change when susceptibility is explicitly considered in policy development; in particular we examine the process used by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) to set a national ambient air quality standard (naaqs) for lead. to determine a naaqs, epa estimated air lead-related decreases in child neurocognitive function through a combination of multiple data elements including concentration-response (cr) functions. in this article, we present alternative scenarios for determining a lead naaqs using cr functions developed in populations more susceptible to lead toxicity due to socioeconomic disadvantage. the use of cr functions developed in susceptible groups resulted in cognitive decrements greater than original epa estimates. epa's analysis suggested that a standard level of 0.15 mu g/m(3) would fulfill decision criteria, but by incorporating susceptibility we found that options for the standard could reasonably be extended to lower levels. the use of data developed in susceptible populations would result in the selection of a more protective naaqs under the same decision framework applied by epa. results are used to frame discussion regarding why cumulative risk assessment methodologies are needed to help inform policy development.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
dust as a collection media for contaminant source attribution,"dust was investigated for its ability to retain source attribution profiles (saps) after chemical exposure. three distinct sources of the organophosphate pesticide acephate were investigated as a proof-of-concept model. in addition, attribution profiles were created and tested using compounds related to chemical warfare agents (cwas), specifically vx and g-series agents: o-ethyl methylphosphonothioate (empta), n, n-diisopropylmethylamine (dipma), n, n-diisopropylethylamine (diea), diisopropylamine (dipa), diethyl aniline (dea), diethyl ethyl phosphonate (deep), trimethyl phosphite (tmp), dimethyl hydrogen phosphite (dmhp), diethyl hydrogen phosphite (dehp), triethyl phosphate (tep), ethyl methylphosphonate (empa), and diisopropyl methylphosphonate (dimp). dust was collected from a storage shed, aliquots deposited on carpet and loaded with distinct chemical profiles using an exposure chamber and aerosolizer. after a given period of time (1 h, 24 h, or 72 h), the dust was extracted and its sap analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and/or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). principal components analysis (pca) was used to determine the association of dust exposed to the same and different chemical sources. pca results demonstrate that dust samples exposed to distinct chemical sources are clearly differentiated from one another across all collection times. furthermore, dust aliquots exposed to the same source can be clearly associated with one another across all collection times. when the cwa-related compounds were subjected to elevated temperature (90 degrees c) conditions, it was found that the signature was stable at the 1 h and 24 h collections. at 72 h and elevated temperature, larger deviations from the control were observed for some compounds. elevated ph (10) affected the profile to a lesser degree than elevated temperature. overall, dust is found to be an effective media for the in situ collection of source attribution profiles.

"exposure to toxic metals and persistent organic pollutants in inuit children attending childcare centers in nunavik, canada","arctic populations are exposed to substantial levels of environmental contaminants that can negatively affect children's health and development. moreover, emerging contaminants have never been assessed in inuit children. in this study, we document the biological exposure to toxic metals and legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (pops) of 155 inuit children (mean age 25.2 months) attending childcare centers in nunavik. blood samples were analyzed to determine concentrations of mercury, lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), pesticides, brominated flame retardants [e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbdes)] and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances [pfass; e.g. perfluorooctanesulfonate (pfos) and perfluorooctane (pfoa)]. lead [geometric mean (gm) 0.08 μmol/l], pcb-153 (gm 22.2 ng/g of lipid), bde-47 (gm 184 ng/g of lipid), pfos (gm 3369 ng/l), and pfoa (gm 1617 ng/l) were detected in all samples. mercury (gm 9.8 nmol/l) was detected in nearly all blood samples (97%). levels of metals and legacy pops are consistent with the decreasing trend observed in nunavik and in the arctic. pbde levels were higher than those observed in many children and adolescents around the world but lower than those reported in some u.s. cities. pfos were present in lower concentrations than in nunavimmiut adults. there is a clear need for continued biomonitoring of blood contaminant levels in this population, particularly for pbdes and pfass.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
development and preparation of lead-containing paint films and diagnostic test materials,"lead in paint continues to be a threat to children's health in cities across the united states, which means there is an ongoing need for testing and analysis of paint. this ongoing analytical effort and especially development of new methods continue to drive the need for diagnostic testing materials that provide the analytical challenges of real-world paints. to this end, 31 different types of paint test materials were developed and prepared. preparation of the materials included development of lead-containing paint films yielding an overall relative standard error for one individual test sample being less than 10%. the 31 diagnostic test materials prepared with these paint films included two lead pigments; lead concentrations from nominally 0 to 2.0 mg lead/cm(2) (0 to 5% lead by weight); overlayers of both """"lead-free,"""" oil-based and water-based paints; al, ba, and mg as potential chemical interferents; red and black potential color interferents; and substrates of wood, metal, masonry, and plaster. these materials challenge each step in method development and evaluation, including paint sample collection and preparation, lead extraction, and measurement of solubilized lead. when the materials were used to test performance of a new lead-in-paint testing method based on extraction using a rotor/stator method and measurement using turbidimetry, the results agreed to within +/- 20% of the expected lead values for 30 out of 31 of the diagnostic test materials, thereby demonstrating their levels of quality and utility.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
pb particles from tap water: bioaccessibility and contribution to child exposure,"high particulate lead (pb) levels can be measured in tap water, but the hazard linked to particulate pb ingestion is unknown. an in vitro test was developed to determine the bioaccessibility of pb particles from tap water, based on the relative bioaccessibility leaching procedure validated for soils, and applied to lab-generated particles and field particles collected behind the aerator tap. field particles were found in 43% of the 342 taps investigated equipped with an aerator, and contained significant amounts of pb (0.003-71%, median 4.7%). the bioaccessibility of lab-generated particles ranged from 2 to 96% depending on the particle type (pb(ii) > brass > pb(iv) > solder), while that of field particles was distributed between 1.5 and 100% (median 41%). the hazard of particulate pb ingestion depends on the amount and concentration ingested, and the bioaccessibility of the particulate pb forms involved. using the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model, the impact of particulate pb on the exposure of children aged 0.5-7 for the distribution system studied was the most significant when considering a fraction of the exposure from large buildings.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead exposure in nunavik: from research to action,"background: in 1999, the government of canada regulated the use of lead shot for hunting. concurrently, the nunavik regional board of health and social services (nrbhss) was informed of the results of an isotope study that pointed to lead ammunition as a likely source of lead exposure in nunavik. rapidly thereafter, a coalition for the banning of lead shot was implemented by the nrbhss as well as by regional/local partners and by inuit hunters in order to disseminate this information to the public. objectives: the purpose of this article is to describe the intervention conducted in the winter of 1999 by the nrbhss and to assess the combined impact of national legislation and an awareness campaign on blood lead levels in nunavik. study design: impact assessment of the intervention for the banning of lead shot conducted in 1999 in nunavik using blood lead levels data before and after the intervention. methods: data on blood lead levels in nunavik describing foetal exposure as well as during childhood and in adults published between 1992 and 2009 were compiled. blood lead levels in nunavik prior to and after the interventions were compared. to assess the current situation, the most recent blood lead levels were compared with those from surveys conducted during the same period in north america. results: analysis of blood samples collected from umbilical cord and from adults show that blood lead levels in nunavik significantly declined between 1992 and 2004. nevertheless, lead exposure in nunavik still remains higher in comparison to that observed in other north american surveys. conclusions: the current situation regarding lead exposure in nunavik has significantly improved as a result of the implemented intervention. however, according to recent data, a gap still subsists relative to other north american populations.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
lead (pb) in tap water and in blood: implications for lead exposure in the united states,"lead is widely recognized as one of the most pervasive environmental health threats in the united states, and there is increased concern over adverse health impacts at levels of exposure once considered safe. lead contamination of tap water was once a major cause of lead exposure in the united states and, as other sources have been addressed, the relative contribution of lead in water to lead in blood is expected to become increasingly important. moreover, prior research suggests that lead in water may be more important as a source than is presently believed. the authors describe sources of lead in tap water, chemical forms of the lead, and relevant u.s. regulations/guidelines, while considering their implications for human exposure. research that examined associations between water lead levels and blood lead levels is critically reviewed, and some of the challenges in making such associations, even if lead in water is the dominant source of lead in blood, are highlighted. better protecting populations at risk from this and from other lead sources is necessary, if the united states is to achieve its goal of eliminating elevated blood lead levels in children by 2020.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"perspective on lead toxicity, a comparison between the united states and iran","lead is a pervasive toxin that has been implicated in human poisonings throughout history. exposure mitigation strategies in the united states and worldwide have led to a decline in symptomatic poisonings and population blood lead levels; however, lead remains a major health hazard. in this article, we review the history of lead toxicity, clinical manifestations ranging from subclinical and subtle features to life-threatening complications, and the subsequent public health interventions in the us. in addition, we explore common routes of lead exposure and the unique differences between the us and iran. although the us has made significant strides with regard to this public health issue, lead poisoning in both countries continues to be a health hazard in the adult and pediatric populations. it is also critical to consider natural disasters and reconstruction efforts as potential sources of lead contamination. in conclusion, we make recommendations that both the us and iranian authorities can implement to eradicate lead as a public health hazard.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

a comparison of screening tests for soil pb,"soil has been identified as a significant source of lead (pb) exposure for both children and adults. therefore, identifying possibly contaminated soils by soil testing is important to protect public health. soil pb test results are usually reported as total pb (in milligrams per kilogram), carried out using a concentrated nitric acid (hno3) digestion procedure by hot plate (environmental protection agency (epa) method 3050) or microwave (epa method 3051) followed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry to determine total pb in the digest. however, this procedure is both time consuming and expensive, sometimes costing homeowners and gardeners more than $50 per sample. to make soil pb testing more economically accessible to homeowners and gardeners, several university soil-testing laboratories offer less expensive screening tests designed to estimate total soil pb. the first objective of this study was to compare three commonly used screening tests, modified morgan, mehlich 3, and 1 m hno3, with the standard total pb testing method (epa method 3051) to find which extractant is the most reliable predictor of total pb. the second objective was to investigate the effect that different degrees of soil grinding have on the total pb test and the extracted pb concentration measured from the 1-m hno3 test. results indicate that the strongest predictor of total pb is 1 m hno3 followed by mehlich 3 and modified morgan, and that thorough grinding is necessary if using less than 5 g of soil in a pb test to adequately homogenize pb-contaminated samples and achieve acceptable testing reproducibility.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead (pb) quantification in potable water samples: implications for regulatory compliance and assessment of human exposure,"assessing the health risk from lead (pb) in potable water requires accurate quantification of the pb concentration. under worst-case scenarios of highly contaminated water samples, representative of public health concerns, up to 71-98 % of the total pb was not quantified if water samples were not mixed thoroughly after standard preservation (i.e., addition of 0.15 % (v/v) hno3). thorough mixing after standard preservation improved recovery in all samples, but 35-81 % of the total pb was still un-quantified in some samples. transfer of samples from one bottle to another also created high errors (40-100 % of the total pb was un-quantified in transferred samples). although the united states environmental protection agency's standard protocol avoids most of these errors, certain methods considered epa-equivalent allow these errors for regulatory compliance sampling. moreover, routine monitoring for assessment of human pb exposure in the usa has no standardized protocols for water sample handling and pre-treatment. overall, while there is no reason to believe that sample handling and pre-treatment dramatically skew regulatory compliance with the us pb action level, slight variations from one approved protocol to another may cause pb-in-water health risks to be significantly underestimated, especially for unusual situations of """"worst case"""" individual exposure to highly contaminated water.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

application of lead monitoring results to predict 0-7 year old children's exposure at the tap,"dwellings with/without a lead service line [lsl] were sampled for lead in tap water in montreal, during different seasons. short-term simulations using these results and the batchrun mode of the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model showed that children's exposure to lead at the tap in the presence of an lsl varies seasonally, and according to the type of dwelling. from july to march, for single-family homes, the estimated geometric mean [gm] blood lead level [bll] decreased from 2.3-3.6 mu g/dl to 1.5-2.5 mu g/dl, depending on the children's age. the wide seasonal variations in lead exposure result in a minimal fraction (0-6%) of children with a predicted bll >5 mu g/dl in winter, as opposed to a significant proportion (5-25%) in summer. these estimations are in close agreement with the blls measured in montreal children in fall and winter, and simulations using summer water lead levels illustrate the importance of measuring blls during the summer. finally, simulations for wartime residences with long lsls confirm the need to prioritize the control of this lead exposure from tap water.

the contribution of housing renovation to children's blood lead levels: a cohort study,"background: routine renovation of older housing is a risk factor for childhood lead poisoning, but the contribution to children's blood lead levels is poorly defined for children with lower exposure levels. methods: we examined a prospective cohort of 276 children followed from 6 to 24 months of age. we conducted surveys of renovation activities and residential lead hazards and obtained blood lead level (b-pb) every six months. we analyzed b-pb in a repeated measures design using a mixed effects linear model. results: parent reported interior renovation ranged from 11 to 25% of housing units at the four, 6-month periods. in multivariable analysis, children whose housing underwent interior renovation had a 12% higher mean b-pb by two years of age compared with children whose housing units were not renovated (p < 0.01). the time between renovation and the child blood lead sample was associated with higher b-pb (p-value for trend <0.01); compared to children in non-renovated housing, children whose housing units underwent renovation in the prior month had a 17% higher mean b-pb at two years of age, whereas children whose housing renovation occurred in the prior 2-6 months had an 8% higher mean b-pb. we also found an association between higher paint lead loading, measured using an x-ray fluorescence (xrf) based paint lead index, and child b-pb (p = 0.02); for every 10 mg/cm2 increase in paint lead loading index there was a 7.5% higher mean childhood b-pb. conclusions: in an analysis of data collected before the recent changes to environmental protection agency's lead, renovation, repair and painting rule, routine interior housing renovation was associated with a modest increase in children's b-pb. these results are important for the provision of clinical advice, for housing and public health professionals, and for policymakers.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
primary prevention of pediatric lead exposure requires new approaches to transfusion screening,"objective to facilitate further assessment of transfusion-associated lead exposure by designing a procedure to test packed red blood cells (prbcs) prepared for transfusion. study design the relationship between prbcs and whole blood lead concentration was investigated in 27 samples using a modified clinical assay. lead concentrations were measured in 100 prbc units. results our sample preparation method demonstrated a correlation between whole blood lead and prbc lead concentrations (r-2 = 0.82). in addition, all 100 prbc units tested had detectable lead levels. the median prbc lead concentration was 0.8 mu g/dl, with an sd of 0.8 mu g/dl and a range of 0.2-4.1 mu g/dl. in addition, after only a few days of storage, approximately 25% of whole blood lead was found in the supernatant plasma. conclusion transfusion of prbcs is a source of lead exposure. here we report the quantification of lead concentration in prbcs. we found a > 20-fold range of lead concentrations in the samples tested. pretransfusion testing of prbc units according to our proposed approach or donor screening of whole blood lead and selection of below-average units for transfusion to children would diminish an easily overlooked source of pediatric lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
body burden of metals and persistent organic pollutants among inuit in the canadian arctic,"inuit living in the arctic are exposed to elevated levels of environmental contaminants primarily due to long-range atmospheric transport. blood sampling and contaminant biomonitoring was conducted as part of the international polar year inuit health survey in 2007-2008. the body burden of metals (e.g. cd, pb) and persistent organic pollutants (e.g. pcbs, ddt & dde, toxaphene, chlordane, pbdes) were measured for inuit participants (n = 2172) from 36 communities in nunavut, nunatsiavut, and the inuvialuit settlement region, in canada. the geometric mean of blood concentrations for cd, pb, pcbs, dde & ddt, toxaphene, and chlordane were higher than those in the canadian general population. a total of 9% of study participants exceeded the intervention guideline of 100 mu g l-1 for pb, 11% of participants exceeded the trigger guideline of 5 mu g l-1 for cd, and 1% exceeded the intervention guideline of 100 mu g l-1 for pcbs. also, 3% of women of child-bearing age exceeded blood pb of 100 mu g l-1 while 28% of women of child-bearing age exceeded 5 mu g l-1 of pcbs. this work showed that most inuit health survey participants were below blood contaminant guidelines set by health canada but that metal and pop body burdens commonly exceed exposures observed in the general population of canada.

a multi-level model of blood lead as a function of air lead,"national and local declines in lead (pb) in blood (pbb) over the past several years coincide with the decline in ambient air pb (pba) concentrations. the objective of this work is to evaluate how the relationship between pbb levels and pba levels has changed following the phase out of leaded gasoline and tightened controls on industrial pb emissions over the past 30 years among a national population sample. participant-level data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) were employed for two time periods (1988-1994 and 1999-2008), and the model was corrected for housing, demographic, socioeconomic, and other covariates present in nhanes. nhanes data for pbb and covariates were merged with pba data from the u.s. environmental protection agency. linear mixed effects models (lmes) were run to assess the relationship of pbb with pba; sample weights were omitted, given biases encountered with the use of sample weights in lmes. the 1988-1994 age-stratified results found that ln(pbb) was statistically significantly associated with ln(pba) for all age groups. the consistent influence of pba on pbb across age groups for the years 1988-1994 suggests a ubiquitous exposure unrelated to age of the sample population. the comparison of effect estimates for ln(pba) shows a statistically significant effect estimate and anova results for ln(pbb) for the 6- to 11-year and 12- to 19-year age groups during 1999-2008. the more recent finding suggests that pba has less consistent influence on pbb compared with other factors.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
housing and child heagth,"the connection between housing and health is well established. physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the child's home, such as cleanliness, moisture, pests, noise, accessibility, injury risks, and other forms of housing environmental quality, all have the potential to influence multiple aspects of the health and development of children. basic sanitation, reduced household crowding, other improvements in housing and expanded, and improved housing regulations have led to advances in children's health. for example, lead poisoning prevention policies have profoundly reduced childhood lead exposure in the united states. this and many other successes highlight the health benefits for families, particularly children, by targeting interventions that reduce or eliminate harmful exposures in the home. additionally, parental mental health problems, food insecurity, domestic violence, and the presence of guns in children's homes all are largely experienced by children in their homes, which are not as yet considered part of the healthy homes agenda. there is a large movement and now a regulatory structure being put in place for healthy housing, which is becoming closely wedded with environmental health, public health, and the practice of pediatrics. the importance of homes in children's lives, history of healthy homes, asthma, and exposures to lead, carbon monoxide, secondhand/thirdhand smoke, radon, allergy triggers is discussed, as well as how changes in ambient temperature, increased humidity, poor ventilation, water quality, infectious diseases, housing structure, guns, electronic media, family structure, and domestic violence all affect children's health.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
lead (pb) is now a non-threshold substance: how does this affect soil quality guidelines?,"risk-based concentrations (rbcs) for lead (pb) in soil were estimated using equations for development of canadian soil quality guidelines. based on the latest toxicological assessments by various health agencies, risk specific doses for pb were defined for children (for impacts on intelligence quotient [iq]) and adults (for impacts on systolic blood pressure [sbp] as well as protection of fetal effects in the case of pregnant women). the analysis suggests that a rbc in soil of 180g/g (dry weight) for residential and other areas where children routinely play is protective of a 1 iq point decrement on a population basis and may actually be associated with decrements of less than 0.2 to 0.35 iq points when the weight of evidence is considered. for soils that children do not contact on a frequent basis, rbcs as great as 8800g/g are considered to be protective of a 1 mmhg sbp increase in adults (as well as iq effects to the fetus). it is stressed that non-soil sources of pb may be even more important than soil. the approach may also be useful in jurisdictions outside of canada as the importance of considering iq decrements on a population basis rather than an individual basis and uncertainties in soil ingestion rates are considered.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

blood lead level and types of aviation fuel in aircraft maintenance crew,"introduction: this study inquired into any significant difference in blood lead levels (blls) among aircraft maintenance crews at the air-bases, each with a different aviation fuel in use, and confirmed an environmental impact of leaded aviation gasoline (avgas). methods: this study included a total of 256 male aircraft maintenance personnel, among whom 105 used only avgas as their aviation fuel, while 151 used only jet propellant 8 (jp-8), a kerosene variety. blls were measured and the data on related factors were obtained. results: the arithmetic and geometric means of blls of the personnel at the airbases that used only avgas were 4.20 mu g upsilon . dl(-1) and 4.01 mu g upsilon . dl(-1) and that used only jp-8 were 3.79 mu g upsilon . dl(-1) and 3.57 mu g upsilon . dl(-1), respectively. the blls of the maintenance crew of the main workspace that was located within a 200-m distance from the runway were higher than those of the main workspace that was located 200 m or farther from the runway. the longer the work hours in the runway or the longer the work duration, the higher the blls of the maintenance crew. discussion: this investigation exposed the fact that a body's bll could be increased by avgas emissions through the examination of aircraft maintenance crew. this result is in agreement with results of previous studies that suggest proximity to an airport may be associated with elevated blls for adults and children. collectively, the results of the current study and previous research suggest that long-duration inhabitation and/or activities in close proximity to an air facility should be limited given that lead poses known health risks.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
determining the relative importance of soil sample locations to predict risk of child lead exposure,"soil lead in urban neighborhoods is a known predictor of child blood lead levels. in this paper, we address the question where one ought to concentrate soil sample collection efforts to efficiently predict children at-risk for soil pb exposure. two extensive data sets are combined, including 5467 surface soil samples collected from 286 census tracts, and geo-referenced blood pb data for 55,551 children in metropolitan new orleans, usa. random intercept least squares, random intercept logistic, and quantile regression results indicate that soils collected within 1m adjacent to residential streets most reliably predict child blood pb outcomes in child blood pb levels. regression decomposition results show that residential street soils account for 39.7% of between-neighborhood explained variation, followed by busy street soils (21.97%), open space soils (20.25%), and home foundation soils (18.71%). just as the age of housing stock is used as a statistical shortcut for child risk of exposure to lead-based paint, our results indicate that one can shortcut the characterization of child risk of exposure to neighborhood soil pb by concentrating sampling efforts within 1m and adjacent to residential and busy streets, while significantly reducing the total costs of collection and analysis. this efficiency gain can help advance proactive upstream, preventive methods of environmental pb discovery.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,environment,outdoor
lead and other heavy metals in dust fall from single-family housing demolition,"objective. we measured lead and other heavy metals in dust during older housing demolition and effectiveness of dust suppression. methods. we used american public housing association method 502 and u.s. environmental protection agency methods sw3050b and sw6020 at 97 single-family housing demolition events with intermittent (or no) use of water to suppress dust at perimeter, non-perimeter, and locations without demolition, with nested mixed modeling and tobit modeling with left censoring. results. the geometric mean (gm) lead dust fall during demolition was 6.01 micrograms of lead per square foot per hour (mu g pb/ft(2)/hour). gm lead dust fall was 14.18 mu g pb/ft(2)/hour without dust suppression;but declined to 5.48 mu g pb/ft(2)/hour (p=0.057) when buildings and debris were wetted. significant predictors included distance, wind direction, and main street location. at 400 feet, lead dust fall was not significantly different from background. gm lead concentration at demolition (2,406 parts per million [ppm]) was significantly greater than background (gm=579 ppm, p=0.05). arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, and manganese demolition dust fall was significantly higher than background (p<0.001). demolition of approximately 400 old housing units elsewhere with more dust suppression was only 0.25 mu g pb/ft(2)/hour. conclusions. lead dust suppression is feasible and important in single-family housing demolition where distances between houses are smaller and community exposures are higher. neighbor notification should be expanded to at least 400 feet away from single-family housing demolition, not just adjacent properties. further research is needed on effects of distance, potential water contamination, occupational exposures, and water application.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

practice-based evidence informs environmental health policy and regulation: a case study of residential lead-soil contamination in rhode island,"prior to 1978, the exteriors of rhode island's municipal water towers were painted with lead-containing paint. overtime, this lead-containing paint either flaked-off or was mechanically removed and deposited on adjacent residential properties. residents challenged inconsistencies across state agencies and federal requirements for collecting and analyzing soil samples. the purpose of this case study was to evaluate the efficacy of rhode island department of health (ridoh) soil sampling regulations in determining the extent of lead contamination on residential properties using real world data. researchers interviewed key government personnel, reviewed written accounts of events and regulations, and extracted and compiled lead data from environmental soil sampling on 31 residential properties adjacent to six municipal water towers. data were available for 498 core samples. approximately 26% of the residential properties had lead soil concentrations >1000 mg/kg. overall, lead concentration was inversely related to distance from the water tower. analysis indicated that surface samples alone were insufficient to classify a property as """"""""lead safe"""""""". potential for misclassification using ridoh regulations was 13%. for properties deemed initially """"""""lead free"""""""", the total number of samples was too few to analyze. post-remediation lead-soil concentrations suggest the extent of lead contamination may have been deeper than initially determined. additional data would improve the ability to draw more meaningful and generalized conclusions. inconsistencies among regulatory agencies responsible for environmental health obfuscate transparency and erode the public's trust in the regulatory process. recommendations for improvement include congruency across departmental regulations and specific modifications to lead-soil sampling regulations reflective of lowered cdc reference blood lead value for children 1 to 5 years old (5 mu g/dl). while scientific research informed the initial development of these environmental health policies and regulations, practice-based evidence did not support their efficacy in context of real world practice.

effect of dietary calcium intake on lead exposure in inuit children attending childcare centres in nunavik,"high blood lead levels (blls) can be found in inuit from nunavik. at the same time, various nutrients such as calcium could lower lead absorption and toxicity. we examined the effect of dietary calcium intakes on blls in 245 preschool inuit children attending childcare centres in nunavik. calcium intake was assessed with one 24-h dietary recall and blls were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in whole blood samples. multiple imputation was performed to deal with missing data. median blood lead concentration was 0.08 μmol/l. a high proportion of children did not meet the estimated average requirement for vitamin d intake (73 %) and, to a lower extent, for calcium (20 %). calcium intake was negatively associated with blls (p = 0.0001) while child's age and energy intake were positively associated with blls (p = 0.015 and p = 0.024, respectively). consuming traditional foods rich in calcium as well as milk and alternatives may protect against lead exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
analysis of u.s. soil lead (pb) studies from 1970 to 2012,"although lead (pb) emissions to the air have substantially decreased in the united states since the phase-out of leaded gasoline by 1995, amounts of lead in some soils remain elevated. lead concentrations in residential and recreational soils are of concern because health effects have been associated with pb exposure. elevated soil pb is especially harmful to young children due to their higher likelihood of soil ingestion. the purpose of this study is to create a comprehensive compilation of u.s. soil pb data published from 1970 through 2012 as well as to analyze the collected data to reveal spatial and/or temporal soil pb trends in the u.s. over the past 40 years. a total of 84 soil pb studies across 62 u.s. cities were evaluated. median soil pb values from the studies were analyzed with respect to year of sampling, residential location type (e.g., urban, suburban), and population density. in aggregate, there was no statistically significant correlation between year and median soil pb; however, within single cities, soil pb generally declined overtime. our analysis shows that soil pb quantities in city centers were generally highest and declined towards the suburbs and exurbs of the city. in addition, there was a statistically significant, positive relationship between median soil pb and population density. in general, the trends examined here align with previously reported conclusions that soil pb levels are higher in larger urban areas and pb tends to remain in soil for long periods of time.

"contribution of particle-size-fractionated airborne lead to blood lead during the national health and nutrition examination survey, 1999-2008","the objective of this work is to examine associations between blood lead (pbb) and air lead (pba) in particulate matter measured at different size cuts by use of pbb concentrations from the national health and nutrition examination survey and pba concentrations from the u.s. environmental protection agency for 1999-2008. three size fractions of particle-bound pba (tsp, pm10, and pm2.5) data with different averaging times (current and past 90-day average) were utilized. a multilevel linear mixed effect model was used to characterize the pbb-pba relationship. at 0.15 μg/m(3), a unit decrease in pba in pm10 was significantly associated with a decrease in pbb of 0.3-2.2 μg/dl across age groups and averaging times. for pba in pm2.5 and tsp, slopes were generally positive but not significant. pbb levels were more sensitive to the change in pba concentrations for children (1-5 and 6-11 years) and older adults (≥ 60 years) than teenagers (12-19 years) and adults (20-59 years). for the years following the phase-out of pb in gasoline and a resulting upward shift in the pba particle size distribution, pba in pm10 was a statistically significant predictor of pbb. the results also suggest that age could affect the pbb-pba association, with children having higher sensitivity than adults.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
racial disparities in children's blood lead levels: possible implication of divalent metal transporter 1,"adverse effects of lead exposure at low-dose (<10 mu g/dl) in children showed a growing interest over the last decades. black ethnicity is usually associated with elevated blood lead levels (blls), independently of age and socioeconomic conditions. the gastrointestinal uptake of lead represents a key step in the process of lead kinetic and toxicity. the involvement of divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) in the lead absorption has been previously presumed and reported. i postulate that inter-ethnic differences in dmt1 expression may explain a large part of the racial disparity in children's blls, and suggest a few analyses to test this hypothesis. the hypothesis rests on some observations from previous researches. the inverse association between blls and iron intake has been reported in both cross-sectional and follow-up studies. it appears that no study specifically addressed the modifying effect of ethnicity in this association. previous reports suggest that dmt1 is the primary mechanism for gastrointestinal iron absorption. there are four forms of dmt1 expressed in the enterocytes, which did not respond similarly to iron changes. it is not excluded that some children be more likely to uptake ingested lead depending on dmt1 isoform expressed. i hypothesize that the expression of the more active dmt1 isoform (+1a/+ire) is more common in non-hispanic black compared with non-hispanic white children, and i suggest how to test this hypothesis. if the hypothesis is confirmed, this would suggest that the prevention of iron-deficiency must be included in the primary programs for preventing increase of blls in non-hispanic black children, rather than as part of secondary prevention. moreover, thorough studies would be useful to characterize the interaction between environmental lead levels and dmti expression in relation to blls in young children.

"spatial prediction of blood lead levels in children in toledo, oh using fuzzy sets and the site-specific ieubk model","lead poisoning in young children remains a concern in many urban areas, even 30 years after the banning of pb- based paint and leaded gasoline. in 2010, 16.6% of 6550 children tested in toledo, oh had blood lead levels (blls) above the centers for disease control (cdc) lead poisoning reference level of 5 mu g/dl. the aim of this study was to spatially quantify the risk of lead poisoning to children in toledo, oh and to reduce lead poisoning risk through educational outreach and citizen science. the educational outreach component of the study was implemented through the sampling strategy. students in toledo area schools were instructed on proper usepa soil sampling guidelines and were asked to collect soil samples from their residential yards. a subsample of 81 soils was analyzed for total lead and bioavailable lead. site- specific total lead and bioavailability data were used in the usepa integrated exposure uptake and biokinetic (ieubk) model to predict blls. predicted blls were then used to extract expert knowledge for development of an index model using analytical hierarchy process (ahp) and weighted linear combination (wlc). expert knowledge was used to standardize predictor datasets and to produce continuous bll risk for each predictor variable. fuzzy sets were implemented in the model to account for uncertainties in the sampling method. it was found that 8.6% of sampled sites had total soil lead concentrations above the usepa action level of 400 mg/kg, but 28.4% of soil samples yielded predicted elevated blls, suggesting the action level is set too high. the spatial variables influencing risk of lead poisoning from most important to least important were age of housing, road density, percent impervious surfaces, home value, household income and soil type. the highest risk for lead poisoning was in the city center and decreased moving towards the rural areas surrounding the city. the index model paired with the unique outreach driven sampling approach proved successful both at providing quality soil samples and educating the community about the ongoing risks of lead in soil.

evolving from reactive to proactive medicine: community lead (pb) and clinical disparities in pre- and post-katrina new orleans,"in 2012 the u.s. centers for disease control (cdc) set the blood pb reference value at ≥5 µg/dl. clinical analysis of children's blood pb levels is the common way to diagnose environmental pb contamination, and intervention ensues with education and household dust cleanup. recent review indicates that education and household dust cleanup are not effective at reducing children's pb exposure. here we review mapping environmental pb and children's blood pb response as an alternative approach for proactive pb dust intervention. new orleans was divided into a high (≥100 mg/kg) and low (<100 mg/kg) soil pb communities. the children's blood pb prevalence ≥5 µg/dl for the high and low pb domains were 58.5% and 24.8% respectively pre-katrina vs. 29.6% and 7.5% post-katrina. elevated soil pb (mg/kg) and consequently pb loading (µg/square area) permeates the high pb domain and outdoor locations lack pb dust safe play areas. the u.s. epa 400 mg/kg soil pb standard poses an outside pb dust loading burden >37 times larger than allowed on interior residential floor environments. environmental pb dust is decreasing because of the transfer of large quantities of low pb soil into selected communities. city-scale soil pb mapping is an alternative diagnostic tool that provides information for planning proactive medicine to prevent clinical pb exposure in the first place.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,exploratory,environment,NA
the influence of declining air lead levels on blood lead-air lead slope factors in children,"background: it is difficult to discern the proportion of blood lead (pbb) attributable to ambient air lead (pba), given the multitude of lead (pb) sources and pathways of exposure. the pbb-pba relationship has previously been evaluated across populations. this relationship was a central consideration in the 2008 review of the pb national ambient air quality standards. objectives: the objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationship between pbb and pba concentrations among children nationwide for recent years and to compare the relationship with those obtained from other studies in the literature. methods: we merged participant-level data for pbb from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) iii (1988-1994) and nhanes 9908 (1999-2008) with pba data from the u.s. environmental protection agency. we applied mixed-effects models, and we computed slope factor, d[pbb]/d[pba] or the change in pbb per unit change in pba, from the model results to assess the relationship between pbb and pba. results: comparing the nhanes regression results with those from the literature shows that slope factor increased with decreasing pba among children 0-11 years of age. conclusion: these findings suggest that a larger relative public health benefit may be derived among children from decreases in pba at low pba exposures. simultaneous declines in pb from other sources, changes in pba sampling uncertainties over time largely related to changes in the size distribution of pb-bearing particulate matter, and limitations regarding sampling size and exposure error may contribute to the variability in slope factor observed across peer-reviewed studies.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

identification of environmental sources of lead exposure in nunavut (canada) using stable isotope analyses,"background: blood lead levels (blls) were measured in the adult inuit population of nunavut, northern canada, during the inuit health survey (ihs) in 2007-2008. approximately 10% of the adult participants had bll over the health canada's guidance of 100μg/l. objectives: 1) to repeat the measurement of bll among the ihs participants with high bll and household members including pregnant women and children under 10years of age; 2) to measure lead (pb) concentrations in environmental samples to identify potential sources and 3) to explore how pb from environmental samples contributes to bll using pb stable isotopic analyses. methods: blood samples were collected from 100 adults and 56 children in 2012. a total of 169 environmental samples (tap water, house dust, paint, country food, soil, and ammunition) were collected from 14 houses from three communities where the ihs participants had the highest bll. total pb concentrations and pb isotope mass balance were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (icp-ms). results: the geometric mean of bll was 43.1μg/l; bll increased with age and was higher in adults than children (71.1 vs. 17.5μg/l). median pb concentrations in water (1.9μg/l) and dust (27.1μg/m(2) for wiped dust, 32.6mg/kg for vacuum dust coarse fraction, and 141.9mg/kg for vacuum dust fine fraction) were generally higher than in other parts of canada. median pb concentrations of food and soil coarse and fine fractions were low (36.6μg/kg, 5.4mg/kg and 11.8mg/kg respectively); paint chips exceeded the canadian guidelines in two houses (median: 3.8mg/kg). discriminant analyses and isotope ratio analyses showed that ammunition and house dust are major sources of pb in this study population. conclusion: analyses of pb stable isotopes are useful to identify the routes of exposure to pb. this approach can contribute to develop targeted public health programmes to prevent pb exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
changes in premature infant mercury and lead blood levels after blood transfusions,"objective to describe the blood level changes of mercury and lead after packed red blood cell (prbc) transfusions in <= 750 g birth weight infants. study design heavy metal blood levels were measured in infants in prbc units on 1st, 4th, 5th, and 7th days (d1, d4, d5, and d7) of life and in urine on d1, d4, and d7. results a total of 10 infants were enrolled with a mean birth weight of 632 +/- 72 g. out of which nine infants received one or more prbc transfusions, with an average of 2.9 +/- 2.5 transfusions per infant. heavy metals were detected in all the transfusions. the average mercury level was 1.33 mu g/l on d1 and 1.66 mu g/l on d7, p > 0.05. the average lead level was 0.32 mu g/dl on d1 and 0.56 mu g/dl on d7, p > 0.05. urinary mercury excretion increased in infants with no bowel movements. urinary excretion of lead decreased over time as blood levels increased. conclusions after receiving blood transfusions, the blood levels of mercury and lead were maintained at the end of the 1st week of life. as there is no evidence of a proportionate increase in excretory amounts of these heavy metals, there is a concern that they are retained and potentially exert toxic effects.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
does the metal content in soil around a pregnant woman's home increase the risk of low birth weight for her infant?,"low birth weight (lbw) is associated with a number of maternal environmental exposures during pregnancy. this study explored the association between soil metal concentrations around the home where the mother lived during pregnancy and the outcome of lbw. we used a retrospective cohort of 9,920 mother-child pairs who were insured by medicaid during pregnancy and lived in ten residential areas, where we conducted soil sampling. we used a grid that overlaid the residential areas and collected soil samples at the grid intersections. the soil was analyzed for the concentration of eight metals [arsenic (as), barium (ba), chromium (cr), copper (cu), lead (pb), manganese (mn), nickel (ni), and mercury (hg)], and we then used bayesian kriging to estimate the concentration at the actual maternal addresses, since we had the gis coordinates of the homes. we used generalized additive modeling, because the metal concentrations had nonlinear associations with lbw, to develop the best fitting multivariable model for estimating the risk of lbw. the final model showed significant associations for female infants, maternal smoking during pregnancy, non-white mothers, cu, and as with lbw. the as variable was nonlinear in relation to lbw, and the association between higher concentrations of as with lbw was strong (p = 0.002). we identified a statistically significant association between soil concentrations of arsenic around the home of pregnant women and an increased risk of lbw for her infant.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
exposure of young children to household water lead in the montreal area (canada): the potential influence of winter-to-summer changes in water lead levels on children's blood lead concentration,"drinking water represents a potential source of lead exposure. the purpose of the present study was to estimate the magnitude of winter-to-summer changes in household water lead levels (wlls), and to predict the impact of these variations on blls in young children. a study was conducted from september, 2009 to march, 2010 in 305 homes, with a follow-up survey carried out from june to september 2011 in a subsample of 100 homes randomly selected. the first 1-l sample was drawn after 5 min of flushing, followed by a further 4 consecutive 1-l samples after 30 min of stagnation. non-linear regression and general linear mixed models were used for modelling seasonal effects on wll. the batchrun mode of integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model was used to predict the impact of changes in wll on children's blood lead levels (blls). the magnitude of winter-to-summer changes in average concentrations of lead corresponded to 6.55 μg/l in homes served by lead service lines (lsl+ homes) and merely 0.30 μg/l in homes without lead service lines. for stagnant samples, the value reached 10.55 μg/l in 'lsl+ homes' and remained very low (0.36 μg/l) in 'lsl- homes'. the change in the probability of blls ≥5 μg/dl due to winter-to-summer changes in wll was increased from <5% (in winter) to about 20% (in summer) in children aged 0.5-2 years. the likelihood of having blls ≥5 μg/dl in young children during warm months was reduced by at least 40% by flushing tap-water.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
an investigation into porch dust lead levels,"lead in porch dust can expose children through direct contact or track-in to the home, but has not been adequately evaluated. at homes undergoing lead hazard control in rochester, ny, we sampled settled dust lead on exterior porch floors at baseline, immediately post-lead hazard control and one-year post-work (n=79 homes with complete data) via wipe sampling and collected housing, neighborhood and soil data. baseline gm porch floor dust lead loading (pbpd) was 68 mu g/ft(2), almost four times more than baseline gm interior floor dust lead (18 mu g/ft(2)). immediate post-work pbpd declined 55% after porch floor replacement and 53% after porch floor paint stabilization (p =0.009 and p=0.041, respectively). when no porch floor work was conducted but lead hazard control was conducted elsewhere, immediate post-work pbpd increased 97% (p=0.008). at one-year, gm pbpd continued to decline for porch replacement (77% below baseline) and paint stabilization (72% below baseline), but where no porch floor work was done, gm pbpd was not significantly different than baseline (p < 0.001, p = 0.028 and p = 0.504, respectively). modeling determined that porch floor replacement had significantly lower one-year pbpd than stabilization when baseline pbpd levels were higher than 148 p,mu g/ft(2) (the 77th percentile) but not at lower levels. treatment of porches with lead paint results in substantial declines in pbpd levels. it is of concern that pbpd levels increased significantly at immediate post-work when lead hazard control was not conducted on the porch but was conducted elsewhere. standards for porch lead dust should be adopted to protect children from inadequate clean-up after lead hazard control.

an exploratory analysis to determine priority areas for lead poisoning prevention education programs in missouri,"lead is a strong poison and toxic to many vital organs and body systems especially in the central nervous system of children, who are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than adults. the purpose of the study described in this article was to examine the relationship between elevated blood lead level (bll) cases of children in the state of missouri and pre-1980 home construction, lead mine proximity, and median household income and to determine counties and areas for statewide prevention education. results of the regression analysis indicated that these combined variables were significant predictors (f[3,111] = 19.106, p < .05, r-2 = .341), accounting for 34.1% of the explained variance in the number elevated bll cases. number of houses built prior to 1980 (beta = .606, p < .05) and median household income (beta = -0.186, p < .05) were specifically revealed to be significant predictors of elevated blood lead cases. in addition to screening in identified counties, missouri's statewide plan should expand to include prevention education in all low-income counties.",missouri,missouri,1,,lead education,sociodemographic,NA

"investigation of childhood lead poisoning from parental take-home exposure from an electronic scrap recycling facility — ohio, 2012","lead affects the developing nervous system of children, and no safe blood lead level (bll) in children has been identified. elevated blls in childhood are associated with hyperactivity, attention problems, conduct problems, and impairment in cognition. young children are at higher risk for environmental lead exposure from putting their hands or contaminated objects in their mouth. although deteriorating lead paint in pre-1979 housing is the most common source of lead exposure in children, data indicate that ≥30% of children with elevated blls were exposed through a source other than paint. take-home contamination occurs when lead dust is transferred from the workplace on employees' skin, clothing, shoes, and other personal items to their car and home. recycling of used electronics (e-scrap) is a relatively recent source of exposure to developmental neurotoxicants, including lead. in 2010, the cincinnati health department and cincinnati children's hospital pediatric environmental health specialty unit (pehsu) investigated two cases of childhood lead poisoning in a single family. in 2012, cdc's national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) learned about the lead poisonings during an evaluation of the e-scrap recycling facility where the father of the two children with lead poisoning worked. this report summarizes the case investigation. pediatricians should ask about parents' occupations and hobbies that might involve lead when evaluating elevated blls in children, in routine lead screening questionnaires, and in evaluating children with signs or symptoms of lead exposure.",ohio,ohio,1,,occupational,case report,NA

incidence of waterborne lead in private drinking water systems in virginia,"although recent studies suggest contamination by bacteria and nitrate in private drinking water systems is of increasing concern, data describing contaminants associated with the corrosion of onsite plumbing are scarce. this study reports on the analysis of 2,146 samples submitted by private system homeowners. almost 20% of first draw samples submitted contained lead concentrations above the united states environmental protection agency action level of 15 μg/l, suggesting that corrosion may be a significant public health problem. correlations between lead, copper, and zinc suggested brass components as a likely lead source, and dug/bored wells had significantly higher lead concentrations as compared to drilled wells. a random subset of samples selected to quantify particulate lead indicated that, on average, 47% of lead in the first draws was in the particulate form, although the occurrence was highly variable. while flushing the tap reduced lead below 15 μg/l for most systems, some systems experienced an increase, perhaps attributable to particulate lead or lead-bearing components upstream of the faucet (e.g., valves, pumps). results suggest that without including a focus on private as well as municipal systems it will be very difficult to meet the existing national public health goal to eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children.",virginia,virginia,1,,structure,residential,indoor

environmental determinants of different blood lead levels in children: a quantile analysis from a nationwide survey,"blood lead levels (blls) have substantially decreased in recent decades in children in france. however, further reducing exposure is a public health goal because there is no clear toxicological threshold. the identification of the environmental determinants of blls as well as risk factors associated with high blls is important to update prevention strategies. we aimed to estimate the contribution of environmental sources of lead to different blls in children in france. we enrolled 484 children aged from 6 months to 6 years, in a nationwide cross-sectional survey in 2008-2009. we measured lead concentrations in blood and environmental samples (water, soils, household settled dusts, paints, cosmetics and traditional cookware). we performed two models: a multivariate generalized additive model on the geometric mean (gm), and a quantile regression model on the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th quantile of blls. the gm of blls was 13.8 mu g/l (= 1.38 mu g/dl) (95% confidence intervals (ci): 12.7-14.9) and the 90th quantile was 25.7 mu g/l (cl: 24.2-29.5). household and common area dust, tap water, interior paint, ceramic cookware, traditional cosmetics, playground soil and dust, and environmental tobacco smoke were associated with the gm of blls. household dust and tap water made the largest contributions to both the gm and the 90th quantile of blls. the concentration of lead in dust was positively correlated with all quantiles of blls even at low concentrations. lead concentrations in tap water above 5 mu g/l were also positively correlated with the gm, 75th and 90th quantiles of blls in children drinking tap water. preventative actions must target household settled dust and tap water to reduce the blls of children in france. the use of traditional cosmetics should be avoided whereas ceramic cookware should be limited to decorative purposes.

population-based comparison of biomarker concentrations for chemicals of concern among latino-american and non-hispanic white children,"differences in cultural and economic status may place ethnic subgroups of children at higher risk for exposure, leading to heightened health risks, and health inequities. although latino-americans represent 22% of all children in the united states, few studies have explored within-group differences in their exposure to toxicants. using socio-demographic and biomarker data from the national health and nutrition examination survey from 1999 to 2008, we characterized determinants of health and estimated geometric means of environmental contaminant biomarkers (blood concentrations of lead and mercury, serum concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [p,p'-dde] and cotinine, and urinary metabolites of organophosphate [op] pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [pahs]) among 4,257 mexican american (ma), 677 other latino-american (ol), and 3,370 non-hispanic white (nhw) children. mas had the lowest levels of health insurance coverage and regular access to health care, and largest household size compared to nhws and ols. mas had higher levels of p,p'-dde, lead, and cadmium while ols had higher estimates of mercury relative to other groups. mas had higher urinary metabolite concentrations of 2-hydroxynaphthalene; otherwise mas and ols had lower concentrations of pahs. nhws had higher levels of cotinine and dimethylthiophosphate. for other op metabolites, differences among groups were less clear. lead and p,p'-dde exposure differences likely reflect later and less regulatory control of these chemicals in latin america. additionally, poor quality housing with lead paint is more common in economically disadvantaged subpopulations. dietary habits are possible sources of differential cadmium, mercury, and organophosphate exposure. cotinine exposure differences by income and u.s.- vs. foreign-born may represent increased acculturation. these results, coupled with additional research on exposure sources may contribute to refinement of environmental health promotion programs for the fast-growing latino-american population.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

geochemical legacies and the future health of cities: a tale of two neurotoxins in urban soils,"the past and future of cities are inextricably linked, a linkage that can be seen clearly in the long-term impacts of urban geochemical legacies. as loci of population as well as the means of employment and industry to support these populations, cities have a long history of co-locating contaminating practices and people, sometimes with negative implications for human health. working at the intersection between environmental processes, communities, and human health is critical to grapple with environmental legacies and to support healthy, sustainable, and growing urban populations. an emerging area of environmental health research is to understand the impacts of chronic exposures and exposure mixtures-these impacts are poorly studied, yet may pose a significant threat to population health. acute exposure to lead (pb), a powerful neurotoxin to which children are particularly susceptible, has largely been eliminated in the u. s. and other countries through policy-based restrictions on leaded gasoline and lead-based paints. but the legacy of these sources remains in the form of surface soil pb contamination, a common problem in cities and one that has only recently emerged as a widespread chronic exposure mechanism in cities. some urban soils are also contaminated with another neurotoxin, mercury (hg). the greatest human exposure to hg is through fish consumption, so eating fish caught in urban areas presents risks for toxic hg exposure. the potential double impact of chronic exposure to these two neurotoxins is pronounced in cities. overall, there is a paradigmatic shift from reaction to and remediation of acute exposures towards a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic cycling of persistent environmental contaminants with resultant widespread and chronic exposure of inner-city dwellers, leading to chronic toxic illness and disability at substantial human and social cost.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
effect measure modification of blood lead-air lead slope factors,"there is abundant literature finding that susceptibility factors, including race and ethnicity, age, and housing, directly influence blood lead levels. no study has explored how susceptibility factors influence the blood lead-air lead relationship nationally. the objective is to evaluate whether susceptibility factors act as effect measure modifiers on the blood lead-air lead relationship. participant level blood lead data from the 1999 to 2008 national health and nutrition examination survey were merged with air lead data from the us environmental protection agency. linear mixed effects models were run with and without an air lead interaction term for age group, sex, housing age, or race/ethnicity to determine whether these factors are effect measure modifiers for all ages combined and for five age brackets. age group and race/ethnicity were determined to be effect measure modifiers in the all-age model and for some age groups. being a child (1-5, 6-11, and 12-19 years) or of mexican-american ethnicity increased the effect estimate. living in older housing (built before 1950) decreased the effect estimate for all models except for the 1-5-year group, where older housing was an effect measure modifier. these results are consistent with the peer-reviewed literature of time-activity patterns, ventilation, and toxicokinetics.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"lead exposure through consumption of big game meat in quebec, canada: risk assessment and perception","game meat from animals killed by lead ammunition may expose consumers to lead. we assessed the risk related to lead intake from meat consumption of white-tailed deer and moose killed by lead ammunition and documented the perception of hunters and butchers regarding this potential contamination. information on cervid meat consumption and risk perception were collected using a mailed self-administrated questionnaire which was addressed to a random sample of quebec hunters. in parallel, 72 samples of white-tailed deer (n = 35) and moose (n = 37) meats were collected from voluntary hunters and analysed for lead content using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. a risk assessment for people consuming lead shot game meat was performed using monte carlo simulations. mean lead levels in white-tailed deer and moose killed by lead ammunition were 0.28 and 0.17 mg kg ¹ respectively. risk assessment based on declared cervid meat consumption revealed that 1.7% of the surveyed hunters would exceed the dose associated with a 1 mmhg increase in systolic blood pressure (sbp). for consumers of moose meat once, twice or three times a week, simulations predicted that 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.5% of adults would be exposed to a dose associated with a 1 mmhg increase in sbp, whereas 0.9%, 1.9% and 3.3% of children would be exposed to a dose associated with 1 point intelligence quotient (iq) decrease, respectively. for consumers of deer meat once, twice or three times a week, the proportions were 1.6%, 2.9% and 4% for adults and 2.9%, 5.8% and 7.7% for children, respectively. the consumption of meat from cervids killed with lead ammunition may increase lead exposure and its associated health risks. it would be important to inform the population, particularly hunters, about this potential risk and promote the use of lead-free ammunition.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
solid-liquid separation method governs the in vitro bioaccessibility of metals in contaminated soil-like test materials,"an in vitro gastrointestinal model was used to explore the role of solid-liquid separation method on the bioaccessibility of trace elements in a smelter-impacted soil (nist-2711) from helena, mt and a mine overburden from an open-pit gold and silver mine in mount nansen, yk (yk-ovb). separation methods studied included centrifugation (5000g, 12000g), syringe microfiltration (0.45 mu m), and ultrafiltration (1000 kda, 50 kda, 30 kda, 10 kda, 3 kda). results indicated that the use of syringe microfiltration generally yields the same bioaccessibility as the use of centrifugation and that the speed of centrifugation does not typically affect metal bioaccessibility. however, ultrafiltration consistently yields a significantly lower bioaccessibility than the use of centrifugation and syringe microfiltration. there are rarely any differences between bioaccessibility estimates generated using a low-resistance (1000 kda) and a high-resistance (3 kda) ultrafiltration membrane; therefore, under the in vitro gastrointestinal conditions modeled herein, negligible quantities of trace elements are complexed to small molecules between 3 and 1000 icda. the primary exceptions to these trends were observed for pb in nist-2711 (5000g > 12000g > 0.45 mu m > ultrafiltration) and for tl in nist-2711 and yk-ovb (5000g similar to 12000g > 0.45 mu m > ultrafiltration). these results provide valuable information to researchers attempting to expand the use of in vitro bioaccessibility beyond soil pb and as.

a population-based study on blood lead levels in blood donors,"background: recent studies suggested that blood transfusion may represent a significant source of lead exposure in premature infants. objectives of this study were to determine blood lead levels (blls) in a representative sample of blood donors and to identify risk factors associated with blls of 0.15 µmol/l or more. study design and methods: a study was conducted in 2006 to 2007 in 49 drive sites in quebec. individuals who qualified for blood donation were eligible to participate. information was harvested from blood donor file and a standardized self-administered questionnaire. lead analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. data on quebec blood donors from 2003 to 2006 (n = 320,543) were used to establish a reference population. geometric mean (gm) and 95% confidence interval (ci) were used to describe the results. the project was approved by an ethics committee. results: of 6715 eligible individuals, 3490 participated (1392 women and 2098 men). their mean age was 46.5 years. results were weighted for region, sex, and age. the gm of blls was 0.082 µmol/l (95% ci, 0.027-0.247; range, 0.011-2.90 µmol/l). blls of more than 0.15 µmol/l were found in 15.5% of participants. in multivariate analysis, blls were mainly explained by age and sex of participants (p < 0.001). a significant association was also found between blls and the region of residence, education level, dwelling age, occupational and leisure activities at high risk for lead exposure, smoking, and alcohol intake (p < 0.001). conclusion: bll in blood donors is strongly explained by sex and age, a fact that can be taken into consideration when transfusing neonates.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
profiling private water systems to identify patterns of waterborne lead exposure,"although extensive literature documents corrosion in municipal water systems, only minimal data is available describing corrosion in private water systems (e.g., wells), which serve as a primary source of drinking water for approximately 47 million americans. this study developed a profiling technique specifically tailored to evaluate lead release in these systems. when applied in an intensive field study of 15 private systems, three patterns of lead release were documented: no elevated lead or lead elevated in the first draw only (type i), erratic spikes of particulate lead (type ii), and sustained detectable lead concentrations (type iii). while flushing protocols as short as 15-30 s may be sufficient to reduce lead concentrations below 15 mu g/l for types i and iii exposure, flushing may not be an appropriate remediation strategy for type ii exposure. in addition, the sustained detectable lead concentrations observed with type iii exposure likely result from corrosion of components within the well and therefore cannot be reduced with increased flushing. as profiling techniques are labor- and sample-intensive, we discuss recommendations for simpler sampling schemes for initial private system surveys aimed at quantifying lead and protecting public health.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"health and growth status of immigrant and refugee children in toronto, ontario: a retrospective chart review","objective: to describe selected anthropometric and health status variables among immigrant and refugee children <= 6 years of age within an inner city clinic in toronto, ontario. methods: a retrospective chart review of patients born between january 1, 1998 and december 31, 2008, was conducted at a toronto community health centre serving a primarily immigrant and refugee population. outcome measures included calculated age-specific percentiles for height and weight, and the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, enteric parasites, elevated lead levels, hiv and hepatitis b. postal codes were collected and used to determine the patient's neighbourhood income quintile. results: a total of 331 patients, born between january 1, 1998 and december 31, 2008, were identified. of these, a total of 210 charts were manually reviewed. the prevalence of height-for-age and weight-for-age under the third percentile on the centers for disease control and prevention growth charts were 7.2% and 11.6%, respectively, and 8.4% and 5.0%, respectively, on the who growth standards chart. prevalence rates were also calculated for anemia (22.8%), iron deficiency (53.3%), hepatitis b (2.5%), parasitic infections (33.6%), elevated blood lead levels (4.9%) and hiv (0%). neighbourhood income quintiles revealed that 46.7% of patients were residing in the lowest (ie, poorest) income quintile neighbourhoods. conclusion: these findings reveal a high burden of illness within the population presenting to an immigrant/refugee health clinic, and illustrate the need for further research in this area, as well as increased efforts to ensure appropriate screening within clinics serving a high volume of newcomer patients.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,

is prenatal lead exposure a concern in infancy? what is the evidence?,"background: exposure to unhealthy and unsafe environments cause 1 in 4 deaths in childhood each year. early exposure to lead beginning prenatally and continuing throughout childhood is one of the mechanisms associated with unhealthy and unsafe environments, particularly in industrial countries and urban communities. lead is a known heavy metal that crosses the placenta and blood-brain barrier depositing in fetal tissues. purpose: the purpose of this integrative review was to determine which maternal-fetal dyads were at high risk for elevated umbilical cord lead (pb2+) levels and to examine the consequences associated with elevated umbilical cord pb2+ levels. search strategy: pubmed was searched to obtain english language publications from 2005 to march 2015 for studies examining the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant outcomes using key terms """"lead"""" combined with """"infant."""" a total of 17 articles were retained for analysis. findings: infants with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels were associated with maternal demographic factors and country of origin. maternal-specific exposure to lead products prior to or during pregnancy was associated with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels. the consequences of prenatal lead exposure to the infant at birth anthropometrically were mixed. the evidence on neurological consequences of prenatal exposure to lead appears to reflect changes in cognitive impairment; however, it needs further study. implications for practice: the major recommendation is primary prevention of lead exposure across the life span. implementation of policies that reduce the availability of leaded products to reduce leaded products, especially ones aimed at children and women of childbearing age. implications for research: research needs to be focused in 2 directions: (1) prevention of lead exposure during pregnancy and (2) prevention of lead leaching from bones for all women of childbearing age.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"prevalence of elevated blood lead levels and risk factors among residents younger than 6 years, puerto rico--2010","context: limited data exist about blood lead levels (blls) and potential exposures among children living in puerto rico. the puerto rico department of health has no formal blood lead surveillance program. objectives: we assessed the prevalence of elevated blls (≥5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood), evaluated household environmental lead levels, and risk factors for bll among children younger than 6 years of age living in puerto rico in 2010. methods: we used a population-based, cross-sectional sampling strategy to enroll an island-representative sample of puerto rican children younger than 6 years. we estimated the island-wide weighted prevalence of elevated blls and conducted bivariable and multivariable linear regression analyses to ascertain risk factors for elevated blls. results: the analytic data set included 355 households and 439 children younger than 6 years throughout puerto rico. the weighted geometric mean bll of children younger than 6 years was 1.57 μg/dl (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.27-1.88). the weighted prevalence of children younger than 6 years with blls of 5 μg/dl or more was 3.18% (95% ci, 0.93-5.43) and for blls of 10 μg/dl or more was 0.50% (95% ci, 0-1.31). higher mean blls were significantly associated with data collection during the summer months, a lead-related activity or hobby of anyone in the residence, and maternal education of less than 12 years. few environmental lead hazards were identified. conclusions: the prevalence of elevated blls among puerto rican children younger than 6 years is comparable with the most recent (2007-2010) us national estimate (blls ≥5 μg/dl = 2.6% [95% ci = 1.6-4.0]). our findings suggest that targeted screening of specific higher-risk groups of children younger than 6 years can replace island-wide or insurance-specific policies of mandatory blood lead testing in puerto rico.",puerto rico,puerto rico,1,,exploratory,screening,NA

multimedia exposures to arsenic and lead for children near an inactive mine tailings and smelter site,"children living near contaminated mining waste areas may have high exposures to metals from the environment. this study investigates whether exposure to arsenic and lead is higher in children in a community near a legacy mine and smelter site in arizona compared to children in other parts of the united states and the relationship of that exposure to the site. arsenic and lead were measured in residential soil, house dust, tap water, urine, and toenail samples from 70 children in 34 households up to 7 miles from the site. soil and house dust were sieved, digested, and analyzed via icp-ms. tap water and urine were analyzed without digestion, while toenails were washed, digested and analyzed. blood lead was analyzed by an independent, certified laboratory. spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between each environmental media and urine and toenails for arsenic and lead. geometric mean arsenic (standard deviation) concentrations for each matrix were: 22.1 (2.59) ppm and 12.4 (2.27) ppm for soil and house dust (<63 mu m), 5.71 (6.55) ppb for tap water, 14.0 (2.01) mu g/l for specific gravity-corrected total urinary arsenic, 0.543 (3.22) ppm for toenails. soil and vacuumed dust lead concentrations were 16.9 (2.03) ppm and 21.6 (1.90) ppm. the majority of blood lead levels were below the limit of quantification. arsenic and lead concentrations in soil and house dust decreased with distance from the site. concentrations in soil, house dust, tap water, along with floor dust loading were significantly associated with toenail and urinary arsenic but not lead. mixed models showed that soil and tap water best predicted urinary arsenic. in our study, despite being present in mine tailings at similar levels, internal lead exposure was not high, but arsenic exposure was of concern, particularly from soil and tap water. naturally occurring sources may be an additional important contributor to exposures in certain legacy mining areas.

"blood lead levels among children aged <6 years - flint, michigan, 2013-2016","during april 25, 2014-october 15, 2015, approximately 99,000 residents of flint, michigan, were affected by changes in drinking water quality after their water source was switched from the detroit water authority (dwa), sourced from lake huron, to the flint water system (fws), sourced from the flint river.* because corrosion control was not used at the fws water treatment plant, the levels of lead in flint tap water increased over time. adverse health effects are associated with lead exposure (1). on january 2, 2015, a water advisory was issued because of detection of high levels of trihalomethanes, byproducts of disinfectants.(†)(,)(§) studies conducted by local and national investigators detected an increase in the prevalence of blood lead levels (blls) ≥5 µg/dl (the cdc reference level) among children aged <5 years living in flint (2) and an increase in water lead levels after the water source switch (3). on october 16, 2015, the flint water source was switched back to dwa, and residents were instructed to use filtered tap water for cooking and drinking. during that time, pregnant and breastfeeding women and children aged <6 years were advised to consume bottled water.(¶) to assess the impact on blls of consuming contaminated drinking water, cdc examined the distribution of blls ≥5 µg/dl among children aged <6 years before, during, and after the switch in water source. this analysis enabled determination of whether the odds of having blls ≥5 µg/dl before the switch differed from the odds during the switch to fws (before and after the january 2, 2015, water advisory was issued), and after the switch back to dwa. overall, among 9,422 blood lead tests in children aged <6 years, 284 (3.0%) blls were ≥5 µg/dl during april 25, 2013-march 16, 2016. the adjusted probability of having blls ≥5 µg/dl was 46% higher during the period after the switch from dwa to fws (and before the january 2, 2015, water advisory) than during the period before the water switch to fws. although unrelated to lead in the water, the water advisory likely reduced tap water consumption and increased consumption of bottled water. characterizing exposure to lead contaminated drinking water among children aged <6 years living in flint can help guide appropriate interventions.",michigan,michigan,1,,policy,water treatment,NA
the impact of low-level lead toxicity on school performance among hispanic subgroups in the chicago public schools,"background: environmental lead exposure detrimentally affects children's educational performance, even at very low blood lead levels (blls). among children in chicago public schools (cps), the severity of the effects of bll on reading and math vary by racial subgroup (white vs. hispanic vs. non-hispanic black). we investigated the impact of bll on standardized test performance by hispanic subgroup (mexican, puerto rican, and other hispanic). methods: we examined 12,319 hispanic children born in chicago between 1994 and 1998 who were tested for bll between birth and 2006 and enrolled in the 3rd grade at a cps school between 2003 and 2006. we linked the chicago birth registry, the chicago blood lead registry, and 3rd grade illinois standard achievement test (isat) scores to examine associations between bll and school performance. primary analyses were restricted to children with bll below 10 µg/dl (0.483 µmol/l). results: blls below 10 µg/dl (0.483 µmol/l) were inversely associated with reading and math scores in all hispanic subgroups. adjusted relative risks (rradj) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) for reading and math failure were 1.34 (95% ci = 1.25, 1.63) and 1.53 (95% ci = 1.32, 1.78), respectively, per each additional 5 µg/dl of lead exposure for hispanic children; rradj did not differ across subgroups. we estimate that 7.0% (95% ci = 1.8, 11.9) of reading and 13.6% (95% ci = 7.7, 19.2) of math failure among hispanic children can be attributed to exposure to blls of 5-9 µg/dl (0.242 to 0.435 µmol/l) vs. 0-4 µg/dl (0-0.193 µmol/l). the rradj of math failure for each 5 µg/dl (0.242 µmol/l) increase in bll was notably (p = 0.074) stronger among black puerto rican children (rradj = 5.14; 95% ci = 1.65-15.94) compared to white puerto rican children (rradj = 1.50; 95% ci = 1.12-2.02). conclusions: early childhood lead exposure is associated with poorer achievement on standardized reading and math tests in the 3rd grade for mexican, puerto rican, and other hispanic children enrolled in chicago public schools. while we did not see interactions between bll and isat performance by hispanic subgroup, the stronger association between bll and math failure for black puerto rican children is intriguing and warrants further study.",illinois,illinois,1,,achievement,health outcome,NA
"blood lead levels in young children: us, 2009-2015","objectives: to evaluate trends in blood lead levels in children <6 years of age, this quest diagnostics health trends report builds on previously reported national health and nutrition examination survey data with a much larger national group and adds more detail and novel assessments. study design: this report describes the results from a 6-year retrospective study (may 2009-april 2015) based on >5 million blood lead level results (including >3.8 million venous results) from children <6 years old living in all 50 states and the district of columbia. we evaluated yearly changes and examined demographic categories including sex, pre-1950s housing construction, poverty income ratios (pirs), medicaid enrollment status, and geographic regions. results: among children <6 years old, 3.0% exhibited blood lead levels ≥5.0 μg/dl (high). there were significant differences in high blood lead levels based on sex, pre-1950s housing construction quintiles, and pir <1.25 and pir >5 (all p < .01). health and human services regions, states, and 3-digit zip code areas exhibited drastically different frequencies of high blood lead levels and blood lead levels ≥10.0 μg/dl (very high). generally, levels declined over time for all groups. conclusion: examination of more than 5 million venous blood lead level results in children younger than 6 years old allowed for a robust, detailed analysis of blood lead level group results by geography and other criteria that are prohibited with the narrower national health and nutrition examination survey database. progress in reducing the burden of lead toxicity is a public health success story that is incomplete with some identified factors posing larger, ongoing challenges.",NA,district of columbia,0,,exploratory,screening,NA
nature and extent of metal-contaminated soils in urban environments (keynote talk),"research on the nature and extent of metal-contaminated soil began with an urban garden study in baltimore, md (usa). largest quantities of soil metals were clustered in the inner city with lesser amounts scattered throughout metropolitan baltimore. the probability values of metal clustering varied from p value 10(-15)-10(-23) depending on element. the inner-city clustering of lead (pb) could not be explained by pb-based paint alone. a major pb source was tetraethyl lead (tel), developed as an anti-knock agent for use in vehicle fuel, thereby making highway traffic flow a toxic substance delivery system in cities. further study in minneapolis and st. paul confirmed the clustering of inner-city soil metals, especially pb. based on the evidence, the minnesota state legislature petitioned congress to curtail pb additives resulting in the rapid phasedown of tel on january 1, 1986, 10 years ahead of the epa scheduled ban. further research in new orleans, louisiana (nola), verified the link between soil pb, blood pb, morbidity, and societal health. although pb is a known cause of clinical impairment, there is no known effective medical intervention for reducing children's blood pb exposure. ingestion and inhalation are routes of exposure requiring prevention, and soil is a reservoir of pb. children's blood pb exposure observed in pre-hurricane katrina (august 29, 2005) nola underwent substantial decreases 10 years post-katrina due to many factors including input of low pb sediment residues by the storm surge and the introduction of low pb landscaping materials from outside of the city. investigation on the topic is ongoing.",NA,maryland,0,,environment,environment,outdoor
analysis of pollution hazard intensity: a spatial epidemiology case study of soil pb contamination,"heavy industrialization has resulted in the contamination of soil by metals from anthropogenic sources in anniston, alabama. this situation calls for increased public awareness of the soil contamination issue and better knowledge of the main factors contributing to the potential sources contaminating residential soil. the purpose of this spatial epidemiology research is to describe the effects of physical factors on the concentration of lead (pb) in soil in anniston al, and to determine the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of those residing in areas with higher soil contamination. spatial regression models are used to account for spatial dependencies using these explanatory variables. after accounting for covariates and multicollinearity, results of the analysis indicate that lead concentration in soils varies markedly in the vicinity of a specific foundry (foundry a), and that proximity to railroads explained a significant amount of spatial variation in soil lead concentration. moreover, elevated soil lead levels were identified as a concern in industrial sites, neighborhoods with a high density of old housing, a high percentage of african american population, and a low percent of occupied housing units. the use of spatial modelling allows for better identification of significant factors that are correlated with soil lead concentrations.",alabama,alabama,1,,environment,sociodemographic,outdoor
estimating children's soil/dust ingestion rates through retrospective analyses of blood lead biomonitoring from the bunker hill superfund site in idaho,"background: soil/dust ingestion rates are important variables in assessing children's health risks in contaminated environments. current estimates are based largely on soil tracer methodology, which is limited by analytical uncertainty, small sample size, and short study duration. objectives: the objective was to estimate site-specific soil/dust ingestion rates through reevaluation of the lead absorption dose-response relationship using new bioavailability data from the bunker hill mining and metallurgical complex superfund site (bhss) in idaho, usa. methods: the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) in vitro bioavailability methodology was applied to archived bhss soil and dust samples. using age-specific biokinetic slope factors, we related bioavailable lead from these sources to children's blood lead levels (blls) monitored during cleanup from 1988 through 2002. quantitative regression analyses and exposure assessment guidance were used to develop candidate soil/dust source partition scenarios estimating lead intake, allowing estimation of age-specific soil/dust ingestion rates. these ingestion rate and bioavailability estimates were simultaneously applied to the u.s. epa integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children to determine those combinations best approximating observed blls. results: absolute soil and house dust bioavailability averaged 33% (sd ± 4%) and 28% (sd ± 6%), respectively. estimated bhss age-specific soil/dust ingestion rates are 86-94 mg/day for 6-month- to 2-year-old children and 51-67 mg/day for 2- to 9-year-old children. conclusions: soil/dust ingestion rate estimates for 1- to 9-year-old children at the bhss are lower than those commonly used in human health risk assessment. a substantial component of children's exposure comes from sources beyond the immediate home environment. citation: von lindern i, spalinger s, stifelman ml, stanek lw, bartrem c. 2016. estimating children's soil/dust ingestion rates through retrospective analyses of blood lead biomonitoring from the bunker hill superfund site in idaho. environ health perspect 124:1462-1470; http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1510144.",idaho,idaho,1,,environment,residential,NA
associations between metals in residential environmental media and exposure biomarkers over time in infants living near a mining-impacted site,"infant exposures to metals are a concern for mining-impacted communities, although limited information is available to assess residential exposures over the first year of life. we measured lead (pb), manganese, arsenic, and cadmium in indoor air, house dust, yard soil, and tap water from 53 infants' homes near the tar creek superfund site (oklahoma, usa) at two time points representing developmental stages before and during initial ambulation (age 0-6 and 6-12 months). we measured infant metal biomarkers in: umbilical cord blood (n = 53); 12- (n = 43) and 24- (n = 22) month blood; and hair at age 12 months (n = 39). we evaluated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between infant residential and biomarker concentrations. a doubling of mean dust pb concentration was consistently associated with 36-49% higher 12-month blood pb adjusting for cord blood pb (p <= 0.05). adjusted dust concentration explained 29-35% of blood pb variance, and consistent associations with other media were not observed. although concentrations in dust and blood were generally low, strong and consistent associations between dust and body burden suggest that house dust in mining-impacted communities may impact children's health. these relationships were observed at a young age, typically before blood pb levels peak and when children's development may be particularly vulnerable to toxic insult.",oklahoma,oklahoma,1,,environment,residential,both
a case study of environmental injustice: the failure in flint,"the failure by the city of flint, michigan to properly treat its municipal water system after a change in the source of water, has resulted in elevated lead levels in the city's water and an increase in city children's blood lead levels. lead exposure in young children can lead to decrements in intelligence, development, behavior, attention and other neurological functions. this lack of ability to provide safe drinking water represents a failure to protect the public's health at various governmental levels. this article describes how the tragedy happened, how low-income and minority populations are at particularly high risk for lead exposure and environmental injustice, and ways that we can move forward to prevent childhood lead exposure and lead poisoning, as well as prevent future flint-like exposure events from occurring. control of the manufacture and use of toxic chemicals to prevent adverse exposure to these substances is also discussed. environmental injustice occurred throughout the flint water contamination incident and there are lessons we can all learn from this debacle to move forward in promoting environmental justice.",michigan,michigan,1,,policy,water treatment,NA
behavioral and environmental explanations of elevated blood lead levels in immigrant children and children of immigrants,"immigrant/refugee children sometimes have substantially higher blood lead levels (blls) than us-born children in similar environments. we try to understand why, by exploring the relationship between immigration status of mother and the blls of us-born children. we compared blls of children born in michigan to immigrant and non-immigrant parents, using the michigan database of bll tests for 2002-2005, which includes the child's race, medicaid eligibility and address. we added census data on socio-demographic/housing characteristics of the child's block group, and information about parents. low parental education, single parent households, mothers' smoking and drinking, all increase the child's bll. however, immigrant parents had fewer characteristics associated with high bll than us born parents, and their children had lower blls than children of us-born mothers. our findings suggest that prior findings of higher blls among immigrant/refugee children probably result from them starting life in high-lead environments.",michigan,michigan,1,,refugee,sociodemographic,NA
"soil lead testing at a high spatial resolution in an urban community garden: a case study in relic lead in terre haute, indiana","industrial emissions, deteriorating or improperly removed lead paint, and the use of lead additives in fuel have left a substantial burden of heavy metals, such as lead, in urban soils. much of this lead remains near the surface where it has the potential to impact human health. exposure to lead, especially in children, can have lasting impacts on neurological development and academic achievement. urban gardening, in particular, is an activity that could result in increased exposure to soil lead for many unsuspecting gardeners. during the summer of 2012, more than 1,061 surface soil samples were collected from an approximately 1.25 acre urban community garden in terre haute, indiana. samples were collected to evaluate the spatial distribution of lead across the community garden on the plot level. the results highlight the variability that can be seen within small areas of a former residential property, for example lead concentrations that are low (<200 parts per million [ppm]) within the same 10 x 10 foot garden plot as concentrations that are considered high (>600 ppm). based on the results of this work, several areas of concern were identified and the community garden was reconfigured to reduce potential lead exposure to gardeners and the local community.",indiana,indiana,1,,environment,environment,outdoor
assessment of blood lead level declines in an area of historical mining with a holistic remediation and abatement program,"lead exposure and blood lead levels (blls) in the united states have declined dramatically since the 1970s as many widespread lead uses have been discontinued. large scale mining and mineral processing represents an additional localized source of potential lead exposure in many historical mining communities, such as butte, montana. after 25 years of ongoing remediation efforts and a residential metals abatement program that includes blood lead monitoring of butte children, examination of blood lead trends offers a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of butte's lead source and exposure reduction measures. this study examined bll trends in butte children ages 1-5 (n= 2796) from 2003-2010 as compared to a reference dataset matched for similar demographic characteristics over the same period. blood lead differences across butte during the same period are also examined. findings are interpreted with respect to effectiveness of remediation and other factors potentially contributing to ongoing exposure concerns. reference population comparison: blls from butte were compared with a reference dataset (n=2937) derived from the national health and nutrition examination survey. the reference dataset was initially matched for child age and sample dates. additional demographic factors associated with higher blls were then evaluated. weights were applied to make the reference dataset more consistent with the butte dataset for the three factors that were most disparate (poverty-to-income ratio, house age, and race/ethnicity). a weighted linear mixed regression model showed butte geometric mean blls were higher than reference blls for 2003-2004 (3.48vs. 2.05µg/dl), 2005-2006 (2.65vs. 1.80µg/dl), and 2007-2008 (2.2vs. 1.72µg/dl), but comparable for 2009-2010 (1.53vs. 1.51µg/dl). this trend suggests that, over time, the impact of other factors that may be associated with butte blls has been reduced. comparison across butte: neighborhood differences were examined by dividing the butte dataset into the older area called """"""""uptown"""""""", located at higher elevation atop historical mine workings, and """"""""the flats"""""""", at lower elevation and more recently developed. significant declines in blls were observed over time in both areas, though uptown had slightly higher blls than the flats (2003-2004: 3.57vs. 3.45µg/dl, p=0.7; 2005-2006: 2.84vs. 2.52µg/dl, p=0.1; 2007-2008: 2.58vs. 1.99µg/dl, p=0.001; 2009-2010: 1.71vs. 1.44µg/dl, p=0.02). blls were higher when tested in summer/fall than in winter/spring for both neighborhoods, and statistically higher blls were found for children in uptown living in properties built before 1940. neighborhood differences and the persistence of a greater percentage of high blls (>5µg/dl) in butte vs. the reference dataset support continuation of the home lead abatement program. conclusions: butte bll declines likely reflect the cumulative effectiveness of screening efforts, community-wide remediation, and the ongoing metals abatement program in butte in addition to other factors not accounted for by this study. as evidenced in butte, abatement programs that include home evaluations and assistance in addressing multiple sources of lead exposure can be an important complement to community-wide soil remediation activities.",montana,montana,1,,environment,abatement,NA

"bioaccessibility of ba, cu, pb, and zn in urban garden and orchard soils","exposure of young children to toxic metals in urban environments is largely due to soil and dust ingestion. soil particle size distribution and concentrations of toxic metals in different particle sizes are important risk factors in addition to bioaccessibility of these metals in the particles. analysis of particle size distribution and metals concentrations for 13 soils, 12 sampled from urban gardens and 1 from orchard found that fine particles (<105 mu m) comprised from 22 to 66% by weight of the tested soils, with ba, cu, pb and zn generally at higher concentrations in the finer particles. however, metal bioaccessibility was generally lower in finer particles, a trend most pronounced for ba and pb. gastric was higher than gastrointestinal bioaccessibility for all metals except cu. the lower bioaccessibility of pb in urban garden soils compared to orchard soil is attributable to the higher organic matter content of the garden soils.

validation and assessment of pediatric lead screener questions for primary prevention of lead exposure,"objective. pediatric lead screener questions have previously been evaluated for their ability to identify children whose blood lead levels (blls) are greater than 10 mu g/dl. based on recent policy changes stressing that there is no safe bll for children, the current study reevaluates the screener questions for their ability to identify children with blls less than 2 mu g/dl and the validity of the questions in positively identifying those at greater risk for exposure. method. a total of 202 parents of children enrolled in head start programs were administered the pediatric lead screener, questions to validate the screener questions, and children's blls were collected in summer 2013. pediatric screener questions were validated against children's bll and the more comprehensive questions on lead risk. results. in predicting bll greater than 2 mu g/dl, the pediatrician screener tool had a sensitivity of 26.3% and specificity of 72.2%. each of the screener questions had low sensitivities for identifying children with blls above 2 mu g/dl. the screener questions did not demonstrate adequate validity when compared against a more comprehensive battery of lead exposure risk indicators. the validation questions improved sensitivity to detect children with bll >2 mu g/dl and reduced the number of false positives. conclusion. the pediatrician screener questions in their current format are not a useful primary prevention tool in identifying children at greater risk for lead exposure and in need of secondary prevention through the receipt of a blood lead test. a revision to the protocol for identifying children at risk could result in better primary and secondary prevention efforts.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"use of a cumulative exposure index to estimate the impact of tap water lead concentration on blood lead levels in 1- to 5-year-old children (montréal, canada)","background: drinking water is recognized as a source of lead (pb) exposure. however, questions remain about the impact of chronic exposure to lead-contaminated water on internal dose. objective: our goal was to estimate the relation between a cumulative water pb exposure index (cwlei) and blood pb levels (bpb) in children 1-5 years of ages. methods: between 10 september 2009 and 27 march 2010, individual characteristics and water consumption data were obtained from 298 children. venous blood samples were collected (one per child) and a total of five 1-l samples of water per home were drawn from the kitchen tap. a second round of water collection was performed between 22 june 2011 and 6 september 2011 on a subsample of houses. pb analyses used inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. multiple linear regressions were used to estimate the association between cwlei and bpb. results: each 1-unit increase in cwlei multiplies the expected value of bpb by 1.10 (95% ci: 1.06, 1.15) after adjustment for confounders. mean bpb was significantly higher in children in the upper third and fourth quartiles of cwlei (0.7-1.9 and ≥ 1.9 μg/kg of body weight) compared with the first (< 0.2 μg/kg) after adjusting for confounders (19%; 95% ci: 0, 42% and 39%; 95% ci: 15, 67%, respectively). the trends analysis yielded a p-value < 0.0001 after adjusting for confounders suggesting a dose-response relationship between percentiles of cwlei and bpb. conclusions: in children 1-5 years of age, bpb was significantly associated with water lead concentration with an increase starting at a cumulative lead exposure of ≥ 0.7 μg pb/kg of body weight. in this age group, an increase of 1 μg/l in water lead would result in an increase of 35% of bpb after 150 days of exposure.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
trends and variability in blood lead concentrations among us children and adolescents,"using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey for the period 2003-2012, the objective of this study was to evaluate trends in blood lead levels (bll) among children aged 1-5 and 6-11 years and smoker and nonsmoker adolescents aged 12-19 years. regression models with log10 transformed values of blls as dependent variable were fitted to evaluate how gender, race/ethnicity, smoking, and exposure to secondhand smoke at home affect blls. irrespective of age, gender, and race/ethnicity, blls declined over the study period (p ≤ 0.01). overall, adjusted blls declined by 0.00114 μg/dl for every 2 years. children aged 1-5 years had about 50 % higher blls than smoker adolescents, about 75 % higher blls than nonsmoker adolescents, and about 45 % higher blls than children aged 6-11 years. while overall, children aged 1-5 years with bll ≥ 5 μg/dl made up 3.24 %, 7.8 % non-hispanic black children aged 1-5 years had bll ≥ 5 μg/dl. males were found to have higher adjusted blls than females, and non-hispanic blacks were found to have higher adjusted blls than non-hispanic whites. higher poverty income ratio was associated with lower adjusted blls (β = -0.02916, p < 0.01). children living in owner-occupied homes had lower adjusted blls than children living in renter-occupied homes. blls increased with increase in number of smokers smoking inside the home (β = 0.02496, p = 0.02). in conclusion, while blls have declined for all age groups, genders, and races/ethnicities, certain races/ethnicities like non-hispanic blacks continue to have substantially higher blls than non-hispanic whites.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
"bisphenol a, phthalates and lead and learning and behavioral problems in canadian children 6-11 years of age: chms 2007-2009","childhood developmental disorders and related problems such as learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) account for a growing burden on the family, education and health care systems. exposure to environmental chemicals such as bisphenol a (bpa) and phthalates may play a role in the development of child behavioral problems. using cross-sectional data from cycle 1 of the canadian health measures survey (chms), we examined the potential association between urinary concentrations of bpa and various phthalate metabolites and child learning and behavioral problems, considering important covariates such as gender, blood lead and environmental tobacco smoke (ets). the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) outcomes of interest were emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, and a total difficulties score with borderline and abnormal scores grouped together and compared with children with normal scores. other outcomes studied included any reported learning disability, a subset of learning disabilities reported as add/adhd (attention deficit disorder) and use of psychotropic medications in the past month. among children ages 6-11 years, the prevalences of any learning disability, add, and adhd were 8.7%, 1.5% and 2.8%, respectively. estimated prevalences for sdq hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms and total difficulties scores were 16.9%, 15.0%, and 13.0%, respectively. child's urinary bpa was associated with taking psychotropic medications (or 1.59; 95% ci 1.05-2.40). urinary mbzp concentration was significantly associated with emotional symptoms in girls (or 1.38 95% ci 1.09-1.75) but not in boys (or 1.05 95% ci 0.82-1.36).) blood lead was significantly associated with several of the outcomes examined, with a significant interaction observed between prenatal smoking and blood lead for the total difficulties score (or=10.57; 95% ci 2.81-39.69 vs. or=1.98; 95% ci 1.41-2.79 if mother did not smoke during pregnancy). although limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study which precludes examining causation, the results suggest that although some indicators of child behavior were significantly associated with their urinary bpa and phthalate concentrations, the major chemical associated with adverse behavioral indicators was lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
detectable blood lead level and body size in early childhood,"rates of childhood obesity have risen at the same time rates of high blood lead levels (blls) have fallen. recent studies suggest that higher bll is inversely associated with body size in older children (ages 3-19 years). no contemporaneous studies have examined if having a detectable bll is associated with body size in very early childhood. we examined if detectable bll is associated with body size in early childhood. a total of 299 birth cohort participants completed a study visit at ages 2-3 years with weight and height measurements; prior to this clinic visit, a bll was drawn as part of routine clinical care. body mass index (bmi) percentile and z-score were calculated; children with bmi a parts per thousand yen85th percentile were considered overweight/obese at age of 2 years. detectable bll was defined as bll a parts per thousand yen1 mu g/dl. a total of 131 (43.8 %) children had a detectable bll measured at mean aged 15.4 +/- 5.5 months. mean age at body size assessment was 2.2 +/- 0.3 years (53.2 % male, 68.6 % african-american). after adjusting for race, sex, and birth weight, children with a detectable bll had a 43 % lower risk of bmi a parts per thousand yen85th percentile (p = 0.041) and a 0.35-unit lower bmi z-score (p = 0.008) compared to children without a detectable bll. neither race nor sex modified this association (all interactions p > 0.21). consistent with recent studies in older children, having a detectable bll was associated with smaller body size at ages 2-3 years. additional research on the mechanism of this association is needed but may include mechanisms of appetite suppression via lead.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
effectiveness of interventions to reduce exposure to lead through consumer products and drinking water: a systematic review,"the objective of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of regulatory, environmental and educational interventions for reducing blood lead levels (blls) and associated health outcomes in children, pregnant women and the general population.searches were run in medline, embase and the global health library up until august 2015. studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the impact of regulatory, environmental or educational interventions, stand-alone or in combination, on blls among children, pregnant women or the general population through randomized controlled trials (rct), controlled before-after (cba), interrupted time series (its), uncontrolled before-after (uba) or repeated cross-sectional studies. studies assessing the impact of interventions to reduce exposure to lead in paint or household dust as well as studies concerned exclusively with environmental concentrations of lead were not included. as documented in a detailed protocol, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were largely undertaken according to cochrane standards. harvest plots were used to graphically summarize evidence of effectiveness.the searches yielded 6466 unique records, of which five met our eligibility criteria; two additional eligible studies were identified by experts. we did not find any studies regarding the effectiveness of regulatory, educational or environmental interventions targeting exposure to lead in consumer products. evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions in reducing blls from exposures through drinking water is limited in both quantity and quality. stand-alone targeted educational interventions showed no statistically significant reductions in children's bll (two rct) when compared to general educational interventions. likewise, instructing women to reduce or eliminate lead-contaminated drinking water showed no effect on bll (one rct). stand-alone environmental interventions appeared more promising in reducing bll (three uba). combining educational and environmental interventions and targeting multiple settings may be effective in reducing bll, as suggested by one uncontrolled before-after study. no studies examining the effectiveness of regulatory interventions were found.the limited quantity and quality of the evidence measuring bll and associated health outcomes points to an urgent need for more robust research into the effectiveness of interventions to reduce lead exposure from consumer products and drinking water, especially for regulatory interventions.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

prevention of childhood lead toxicity,"blood lead concentrations have decreased dramatically in us children over the past 4 decades, but too many children still live in housing with deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk for lead exposure with resulting lead-associated cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those below 5 mu g/dl (50 ppb), impair cognition; there is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood. from 2007 to 2010, approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the united states had a blood lead concentration >= 5 mu g/dl (>= 50 ppb), which represents about 535 000 us children 1 to 5 years of age. evidence-based guidance is available for managing increased lead exposure in children, and reducing sources of lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer products, has been shown to be cost-beneficial. primary prevention should be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
evaluating the effects of full and partial lead service line replacement on lead levels in drinking water,"lead service line replacement (lslr) is an important strategy for reducing lead exposure via drinking water, but jurisdictional issues can sometimes interfere with full replacement of the lead line. the effects of full and partial lslr on lead levels were assessed using 5 x 1-l sample profiles collected at more than 100 single-unit residences. profiles comprised four sequential standing samples (l1-l4) and a free flowing sample (l5) drawn after a 5 min flush of the outlet. at 45 sites with full lead service lines, 90th percentile lead levels in standing samples ranged from 16.4 to 44.5 mu g l-1 (l1 and l4, respectively). in the free-flowing sample (l5), 90th percentile lead was 9.8 mu g l-1. within 3 days, full lslr had reduced l3-l5 lead levels by more than 50%, and within 1 month, lead levels were significantly lower in every liter of the sample profile. conversely, partial lslr more than doubled premises plumbing (l1, l2) lead release in the short term and did not reduce l1, l2 lead release in the long term. even 6 months after partial lslr, 27% of first-draw lead levels were greater than 15 mu g l-1 (the u.s. epa action level), compared with 13% pre-replacement.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
evaluation of exposure to lead from drinking water in large buildings,"lead results from 78,971 water samples collected in four canadian provinces from elementary schools, daycares, and other large buildings using regulatory and investigative sampling protocols were analyzed to provide lead concentration distributions. maximum concentrations reached 13,200 and 3890 mu g/l following long and short stagnation periods respectively. high lead levels were persistent in some large buildings, reflected by high median values considering all taps, or specific to a few taps in the building. simulations using the integrated uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model and lead concentrations after 30 min of stagnation in the dataset showed that, for most buildings, exposure to lead at the tap does not increase children's blood lead levels (blls). however, buildings or taps with extreme concentrations represent a significant health risk to young children attending school or daycare, as the estimated bll far exceeded the 5 mu g/dl threshold. ingestion of water from specific taps could lead to acute exposure. finally, for a few taps, the total daily lead intake reached the former world health organization (who) tolerable level for adults, suggesting potential health risks.

estimated lead (pb) exposures for a population of urban community gardeners,"urban community gardens provide affordable, locally grown, healthy foods and many other benefits. however, urban garden soils can contain lead (pb) that may pose risks to human health. to help evaluate these risks, we measured pb concentrations in soil, vegetables, and chicken eggs from new york city community gardens, and we asked gardeners about vegetable consumption and time spent in the garden. we then estimated pb intakes deterministically and probabilistically for adult gardeners, children who spend time in the garden, and adult (non-gardener) household members. most central tendency pb intakes were below provisional total tolerable intake (ptti) levels. high contact intakes generally exceeded pttis. probabilistic estimates showed approximately 40 % of children and 10 % of gardeners exceeding pttis. children's exposure came primarily from dust ingestion and exposure to higher pb soil between beds. gardeners' pb intakes were comparable to children's (in a mu g/day) but were dominated by vegetable consumption. adult household members ate less garden-grown produce than gardeners and had the lowest pb intakes. our results suggest that healthy gardening practices to reduce pb exposure in urban community gardens should focus on encouraging cultivation of lower pb vegetables (i.e., fruits) for adult gardeners and on covering higher pb non-bed soils accessible to young children. however, the common practice of replacement of root-zone bed soil with clean soil (e.g., in raised beds) has many benefits and should also continue to be encouraged.",nongeographical,new york,0,New York City,environment,environment,outdoor

lead poisoning in a 16-year-old girl: a case report and a review of the literature (care compliant),"background: lead is a toxic element of the environment which leads to major complications once it enters the blood stream, affecting multiple organs and systems of the body. methods: we present the case of a 16-year-old girl, diagnosed with lead poisoning after occupational exposure due to the fact that the girl was actively involved in the family's pottery business.history revealed that the girl participated in the process of pottery, her father was also diagnosed with lead poisoning 2 years before. the patient's personal history underlined that approximately 1 year ago she presented with severe abdominal pain, being diagnosed with acute appendicitis and she underwent appendectomy, but the pain persisted, thus due to family history of lead poisoning, the suspicion of saturnine colic rose, and she was diagnosed with lead poisoning. the main symptoms and signs were severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and arterial hypertension. the clinical evolution was favorable under symptomatic treatment and chelation therapy. results: lead toxicity is a life-threatening condition because of its severe acute and chronic complications. in children, there is no safe blood lead level, prevention methods are, therefore, very important in order to avoid toxic multiorganic effects of this metal. conclusion: even though the diagnosis of lead poisoning remains difficult in children, it must also be taken into consideration by the clinician facing a child with gastrointestinal or neurological involvement.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
spatiotemporal dynamic transformations of soil lead and children's blood lead ten years after hurricane katrina: new grounds for primary prevention,"background: the contribution of lead contaminated soil to blood lead, especially as it is a large reservoir of lead dust, has been underestimated relative to lead-based paint. on 29 august 2005 hurricane katrina flooded and disrupted habitation in new orleans. soil and blood lead were mapped prior to katrina. this unique study addresses soil and blood lead conditions pre- and ten years post-katrina and considers the effectiveness of low lead soil for lead exposure intervention. objectives: comparison of soil and blood lead levels pre- and ten years post-katrina to evaluate and assess the impact of flooding on soil and blood lead at the scale of the city of new orleans. methods: post-katrina soil and blood lead data were stratified by the same census tracts (n=176) as pre-katrina data. this unique city scale data-set includes soil lead (n=3314 and 3320, pre- vs. post-katrina), blood lead (n=39,620 and 17,739, pre- vs. post-katrina), distance, and changes in percent pre-1940 housing. statistical analysis entailed permutation procedures and fisher's exact tests. results: pre- vs. ten years post-katrina soil lead median decreased from 280 mg/kg to 132 mg/kg, median blood lead decreased from 5μg/dl to 1.8μg/dl, respectively. percent pre-1940 housing did not change significantly (p-value=0.674). soil and blood lead decrease with distance from the center of new orleans. except for age-of-housing results, p-values were extremely small (<10(-12)). conclusions: ten years after katrina, profound changes in soil lead and children's blood lead occurred in new orleans. decreasing the lead on soil surfaces reduces children's interaction with lead dust, thus underscoring soil as a major of source of exposure.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,environment,outdoor
costs of iq loss from leaded aviation gasoline emissions,"in the united states, general aviation piston-driven aircraft are now the largest source of lead emitted to the atmosphere. elevated lead concentrations impair children's iq and can lead to lower earnings potentials. this study is the first assessment of the nationwide annual costs of iq losses from aircraft lead emissions. we develop a general aviation emissions inventory for the continental united states and model its impact on atmospheric concentrations using the community multi-scale air quality model (cmaq). we use these concentrations to quantify the impacts of annual aviation lead emissions on the u.s. population using two methods: through static estimates of cohort-wide iq deficits and through dynamic economy-wide effects using a computational general equilibrium model. we also examine the sensitivity of these damage estimates to different background lead concentrations, showing the impact of lead controls and regulations on marginal costs. we find that aircraft-attributable lead contributes to $1.06 billion 2006 usd ($0.01-$11.6) in annual damages from lifetime earnings reductions, and that dynamic economy-wide methods result in damage estimates that are 54% larger. because the marginal costs of lead are dependent on background concentration, the costs of piston-driven aircraft lead emissions are expected to increase over time as regulations on other emissions sources are tightened.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

the formal electronic recycling industry: challenges and opportunities in occupational and environmental health research,"background: e-waste includes electrical and electronic equipment discarded as waste without intent of reuse. informal e-waste recycling, typically done in smaller, unorganized businesses, can expose workers and communities to serious chemical health hazards. it is unclear if formalization into larger, better-controlled electronics recycling (e-recycling) facilities solves environmental and occupational health problems. objectives: to systematically review the literature on occupational and environmental health hazards of formal e recycling facilities and discuss challenges and opportunities to strengthen research in this area. methods: we identified 37 publications from 4 electronic databases (pubmed, web of science, environmental index, nioshtic-2) specific to chemical exposures in formal e-recycling facilities. discussion: environmental and occupational exposures depend on the degree of formalization of the facilities but further reduction is needed. reported worker exposures to metals were often higher than recommended occupational guidelines. levels of brominated flame-retardants in worker's inhaled air and biological samples were higher than those from reference groups. air, dust, and soil concentrations of metals, brominated flame-retardants, dioxins, furans, polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls found inside or near the facilities were generally higher than reference locations, suggesting transport into the environment. children of a recycler had blood lead levels higher than public health recommended guidelines. conclusions: with mounting e-waste, more workers, their family members, and communities could experience unhealthful exposures to metals and other chemicals. we identified research needs to further assess exposures, health, and improve controls. the long-term solution is manufacturing of electronics without harmful substances and easy-to-disassemble components.

analysis of multiple-variable missing-not-at-random survey data for child lead surveillance using nhanes,"background: although ongoing, multi-topic surveys form the basis of public health surveillance in many countries, their utility for specific subject matter areas can be limited by high proportions of missing data. for example, the national health and examination survey is the main resource for surveillance of elevated blood lead levels (eblls) in us children, but key predictor variables are missing for as many as 35% of respondents. methods: using a bayesian framework, we formulate a t-distributed heckman selection model applicable to the case of multiple missing-not-at-random variables in the context of a complex survey design. we demonstrate the utility of the results by calculating prevalence estimates for lead levels exceeding 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 µg/dl among children 1 to 5 years of age for a variety of time points and geographies by applying the coefficients to data from the american community survey from the us census. results: we present a protocol for estimating posterior distributions of parameters using gibbs and grid sampling steps. stark disparities in the prevalence of ebll by race/ethnicity, age of housing, and poverty are readily quantified, and three- to five-fold differences in predicted prevalence across geographies within the us are presented. conclusions: we are able to conduct multivariate analyses of eblls that incorporate the crucial variable age of housing, analyses that have not been previously available using these data. this represents an expansion of the utility of national health and examination survey that is likely to be relevant to many similar ongoing, multi-topic health surveillance efforts. copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in both rural and urban iowa newborns: spatial patterns and area-level covariates,"lead in maternal blood can cross the placenta and result in elevated blood lead levels in newborns, potentially producing negative effects on neurocognitive function, particularly if combined with childhood lead exposure. little research exists, however, into the burden of elevated blood lead levels in newborns, or the places and populations in which elevated lead levels are observed in newborns, particularly in rural settings. using ~2300 dried bloods spots collected within 1-3 days of birth among iowa newborns, linked with the area of mother's residence at the time of birth, we examine the spatial patterns of elevated (>5 μg/dl) blood lead levels and the ecological-level predictors of elevated blood lead levels. we find that one in five newborns exceed the 5 μg/dl action level set by the us centers for disease control & prevention (cdc). bayesian spatial zero inflated regression indicates that elevated blood lead in newborns is associated with areas of increased pre-1940s housing and childbearing-age women with low educational status in both rural and urban settings. no differences in blood lead levels or the proportion of children exceeding 5 μg/dl are observed between urban and rural maternal residence, though a spatial cluster of elevated blood lead is observed in rural counties. these characteristics can guide the recommendation for testing of infants at well-baby appointments in places where risk factors are present, potentially leading to earlier initiation of case management. the findings also suggest that rural populations are at as great of risk of elevated blood lead levels as are urban populations. analysis of newborn dried blood spots is an important tool for lead poisoning surveillance in newborns and can direct public health efforts towards specific places and populations where lead testing and case management will have the greatest impact.",iowa,iowa,1,,maternity,prenatal,NA
"interrupted time series analysis of children's blood lead levels: a case study of lead hazard control program in syracuse, new york","children's blood lead concentrations have been closely monitored over the last two decades in the united states. the bio-monitoring surveillance data collected in local agencies reflected the local temporal trends of children's blood lead levels (blls). however, the analysis and modeling of the long-term time series of blls have rarely been reported. we attempted to quantify the long-term trends of children's blls in the city of syracuse, new york and evaluate the impacts of local lead poisoning prevention programs and lead hazard control program on reducing the children's blls. we applied interrupted time series analysis on the monthly time series of blls surveillance data and used arma (autoregressive and moving average) models to measure the average children's blood lead level shift and detect the seasonal pattern change. our results showed that there were three intervention stages over the past 20 years to reduce children's blls in the city of syracuse, ny. the average of children's blls was significantly decreased after the interventions, declining from 8.77μg/dl to 3.94μg/dl during1992 to 2011. the seasonal variation diminished over the past decade, but more short term influences were in the variation. the lead hazard control treatment intervention proved effective in reducing the children's blood lead levels in syracuse, ny. also, the reduction of the seasonal variation of children's blls reflected the impacts of the local lead-based paint mitigation program. the replacement of window and door was the major cost of lead house abatement. however, soil lead was not considered a major source of lead hazard in our analysis.",new york,new york,1,,screening,abatement,NA

the effect of leaded aviation gasoline on blood lead in children,"lead is a neurotoxin with developmentally harmful effects in children. in the united states, over half the current flow of lead into the atmosphere is attributable to lead-formulated aviation gasoline (avgas), used in a large fraction of piston-engine aircraft. various public interest firms have petitioned the epa to find endangerment from and regulate lead emitted by piston-engine aircraft, though the epa has so far ruled against such petitions. to address an epa request for more evidence, we construct a novel data set that links time and spatially referenced blood lead data from over a million children to 448 nearby airports in michigan. across a series of tests, and adjusting for other known sources of lead exposure, we find that child blood lead levels (1) increase dose-responsively in proximity to airports, (2) decline measurably among children sampled in the months after 9/11, (3) increase dose-responsively in the flow of piston-engine aircraft traffic, (4) increase in the percentage of prevailing wind days drifting in the direction of a child’s residential location, and (5) behave intuitively and significantly when considering two-way and three-way interactions of our main treatment variables. to quantify the policy relevance of the results we provide a conservative estimate of the social damages attributable to avgas consumption. damages are at least $10 per gallon, which can be compared to a pump price of about $6 per gallon.",michigan,michigan,1,,environment,environment,NA

laboratory screening for children entering foster care,"objectives:to determine the prevalence of medical illness detected by laboratory screening in children entering foster care in a single, urban county. methods:all children entering foster care in a single county in ohio were seen at a consultation foster care clinic and had laboratory screening, including testing for infectious diseases such as hiv, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, syphilis, and tuberculosis as well as for hemoglobin and lead levels. results:over a 3-year period (2012-2015), laboratory screening was performed on 1977 subjects entering foster care in a consultative foster care clinic. the prevalence of hepatitis b, hepatitis c, syphilis, and tuberculosis were all found to be <1%. there were no cases of hiv. seven percent of teenagers entering foster care tested positive for chlamydia. a secondary finding was that 54% of subjects were hepatitis b surface antibody-negative, indicating an absence of detected immunity to the hepatitis b virus. conclusions:routine laboratory screening for children entering foster care resulted in a low yield. targeted, rather than routine, laboratory screening may be a more clinically meaningful approach for children entering foster care.",ohio,ohio,1,,sociodemographic,screening,NA
"lead emissions and population vulnerability in the detroit (michigan, usa) metropolitan area, 2006-2013: a spatial and temporal analysis","objective: the purpose of this research is to geographically model airborne lead emission concentrations and total lead deposition in the detroit metropolitan area (dma) from 2006 to 2013. further, this study characterizes the racial and socioeconomic composition of recipient neighborhoods and estimates the potential for iq (intelligence quotient) loss of children residing there. methods: lead emissions were modeled from emitting facilities in the dma using aermod (american meteorological society/environmental protection agency regulatory model). multilevel modeling was used to estimate local racial residential segregation, controlling for poverty. global moran's i bivariate spatial autocorrelation statistics were used to assess modeled emissions with increasing segregation. results: lead emitting facilities were primarily located in, and moving to, highly black segregated neighborhoods regardless of poverty levels-a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. the findings from this research showed three years of elevated airborne emission concentrations in these neighborhoods to equate to a predicted 1.0 to 3.0 reduction in iq points for children living there. across the dma there are many areas where annual lead deposition was substantially higher than recommended for aquatic (rivers, lakes, etc.) and terrestrial (forests, dunes, etc.) ecosystems. these lead levels result in decreased reproductive and growth rates in plants and animals, and neurological deficits in vertebrates. conclusions: this lead-hazard and neighborhood context assessment will inform future childhood lead exposure studies and potential health consequences in the dma.",michigan,michigan,1,,environment,sociodemographic,outdoor
lead exposure at firing ranges-a review,"background lead (pb) is a toxic substance with well-known, multiple, long-term, adverse health outcomes. shooting guns at firing ranges is an occupational necessity for security personnel, police officers, members of the military, and increasingly a recreational activity by the public. in the united states alone, an estimated 16,000-18,000 firing ranges exist. discharge of pb dust and gases is a consequence of shooting guns. methods the objectives of this study are to review the literature on blood lead levels (blls) and potential adverse health effects associated with the shooting population. the search terms “blood lead”, “lead poisoning”, “lead exposure”, “marksmen”, “firearms”, “shooting”, “guns”, “rifles” and “firing ranges” were used in the search engines google scholar, pubmed and science direct to identify studies that described blls in association with firearm use and health effects associated with shooting activities. results thirty-six articles were reviewed that included blls from shooters at firing ranges. in 31 studies blls > 10 μg/dl were reported in some shooters, 18 studies reported blls > 20 μg/dl, 17 studies > 30 μg/d, and 15 studies blls > 40 μg/dl. the literature indicates that blls in shooters are associated with pb aerosol discharge from guns and air pb at firing ranges, number of bullets discharged, and the caliber of weapon fired. conclusions shooting at firing ranges results in the discharge of pb dust, elevated blls, and exposures that are associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. women and children are among recreational shooters at special risk and they do not receive the same health protections as occupational users of firing ranges. nearly all bll measurements compiled in the reviewed studies exceed the current reference level of 5 μg/dl recommended by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention/national institute of occupational safety and health (cdc/niosh). thus firing ranges, regardless of type and user classification, currently constitute a significant and unmanaged public health problem. prevention includes clothing changed after shooting, behavioural modifications such as banning of smoking and eating at firing ranges, improved ventilation systems and oversight of indoor ranges, and development of airflow systems at outdoor ranges. eliminating lead dust risk at firing ranges requires primary prevention and using lead-free primers and lead-free bullets.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

modeling soluble and particulate lead release into drinking water from full and partially replaced lead service lines,"partial replacement of lead service lines (lsls) often results in the excessive long-term release of lead particulates due to the disturbance of pipe scale and galvanic corrosion. in this study, a modeling approach to simulate the release and transport of particulate and dissolved lead from full and partially replaced lsls is developed. a mass-transfer model is coupled with a stochastic residential water demand generator to investigate the effect of normal household usage flow patterns on lead exposure. the model is calibrated by comparing simulation results against experimental measurements from pilot-scale setups where lead release under different flow rates and water chemistry scenarios was reported. applying the model within a monte carlo simulation framework, partial replacement of the lsl was predicted to result in releasing spikes with significantly high concentrations of particulate lead (1011.9 +/- 290.3 mu g/l) that were five times higher than those released from the simulated full lsl. sensitivity analysis revealed that the intensity of flow demands significantly affects particulate lead release, while dissolved lead levels are more dependent on the lengths of the stagnation periods. preflushing of the lsl prior to regulatory sampling was found to underestimate the maximum monthly exposure to dissolved lead by 19%, while sampling at low flow rates (<5.2 lpm) was found to consistently suppress the high spikes induced by particulate lead mobilization.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

the drinking water contamination crisis in flint: modeling temporal trends of lead level since returning to detroit water system,"since flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water close to 25,000 water samples have been collected and tested for lead and copper in >10,000 residences. this paper presents the first analysis and time trend modeling of lead data, providing new insights about the impact of this intervention. the analysis started with geocoding all water lead levels (wll) measured during an 11-month period following the return to the detroit water supply. each data was allocated to the corresponding tax parcel unit and linked to secondary datasets, such as the composition of service lines, year built, or census tract poverty level. only data collected on residential parcels within the city limits were used in the analysis. one key feature of flint data is their collection through two different sampling initiatives: (i) voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (non-sentinel sites), and (ii) state-controlled sampling where data were collected bi-weekly at selected sites after training of residents by technical teams (sentinel sites). temporal trends modeled from these two datasets were found to be statistically different with fewer sentinel data exceeding wll thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mu g/l. even after adjusting for housing characteristics the odds ratio (or) of measuring wll above 15 mu g/l at non-sentinel sites is significantly >1 (or = 1.480) and it increases with the threshold (or = 2.055 for 50 mu g/l)joinpoint regression showed that the city-wide percdntage of wll data above 15 mu g/l displayed four successive trends since the return to detroit water system. despite the recent improvement in water quality, the culprit for differences between sampling programs needs to be identified as it impacts exposure assessment and might influence whether there is compliance or not with the lead and copper rule.

monitoring the aftermath of flint drinking water contamination crisis: another case of sampling bias?,"the delay in reporting high levels of lead in flint drinking water, following the city's switch to the flint river as its water supply, was partially caused by the biased selection of sampling sites away from the lead pipe network. since flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water, the state has been monitoring water lead levels (wll) at selected """"sentinel"""" sites. in a first phase that lasted two months, 739 residences were sampled, most of them bi-weekly, to determine the general health of the distribution system and to track temporal changes in lead levels. during the same period, water samples were also collected through a voluntary program whereby concerned citizens received free testing kits and conducted sampling on their own. state officials relied on the former data to demonstrate the steady improvement in water quality. a recent analysis of data collected by voluntary sampling revealed, however, an opposite trend with lead levels increasing over time. this paper looks at potential sampling bias to explain such differences. although houses with higher wll were more likely to be sampled repeatedly, voluntary sampling turned out to reproduce fairly well the main characteristics (i.e. presence of lead service lines (lsl), construction year) of flint housing stock. state-controlled sampling was less representative; e.g., sentinel sites with lsl were mostly built between 1935 and 1950 in lower poverty areas, which might hamper our ability to disentangle the effects of lsl and premise plumbing (lead fixtures and pipes present within old houses) on wll. also, there was no sentinel site with lsl in two of the most impoverished wards, including where the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels tripled following the switch in water supply. correcting for sampling bias narrowed the gap between sampling programs, yet overall temporal trends are still opposite.

case studies and evidence-based approaches to addressing urban soil lead contamination,"urban soils in many communities in the united states and internationally have been contaminated by lead (pb) from past use of lead additives in gasoline, deterioration of exterior paint, emissions from pb smelters and battery recycling and other industries. exposure to pb in soil and related dust is widespread in many inner city areas. up to 20-40% of urban children in some neighborhoods have blood lead levels (blls) equal to or above 5 mu g per decilitre, the reference level of health concern by the u.s. centers for disease control. given the widespread nature of pb contamination in urban soils it has proven a challenge to reduce exposure. in order to prevent this exposure, an evidence-based approach is required to isolate or remediate the soils and prevent children and adult's ongoing exposure. to date, the majority of community soil pb remediation efforts have been focused in mining towns or in discrete neighborhoods where pb smelters have impacted communities. these efforts have usually entailed very expensive dig and dump soil pb remediation techniques, funded by the point source polluters. remediating widespread non-point source urban soil contamination using this approach is neither economical nor feasible from a practical standpoint. despite the need to remediate/isolate urban soils in inner city areas, no deliberate, large scale, cost effective pb remediation schemes have been implemented to isolate inner city soils impacted from sources other than mines and smelters. however, a city-wide natural experiment of flooding in new orleans by hurricane katrina demonstrated that declines in soil pb resulted in major bll reductions. also a growing body of literature of smaller scale pilot studies and programs does exist regarding low cost efforts to isolate pb contaminated urban soils. this paper reviews the literature regarding the effectiveness of soil pb remediation for reducing pb exposure and bll in children, and suggests best practices for addressing the epidemics of low-level pb poisoning occurring in many inner city areas.

four phases of the flint water crisis: evidence from blood lead levels in children,"the flint water crisis (fwc) is divisible into four phases of child water-lead exposure risk: phase a) before the switch in water source to the flint river (our baseline); phase b) after the switch in water source, but before boil water advisories; phase c) after boil water advisories, but before the switch back to the baseline water source of the detroit water and sewerage department (dwsd); and phase d) after the switch back to dwsd. the objective of this work is to estimate water-lead attributable movements in child blood lead levels (blls) that correspond with the four phases in the fwc. with over 21,000 geo-referenced and time-stamped blood lead samples from children in genesee county drawn from january 01, 2013 to july 19, 2016, we develop a series of quasi experimental models to identify the causal effect of water-lead exposure on child blls in flint. we find that the switch in water source (transitioning from phase a to b) caused mean blls to increase by about 0.5 mu g/dl, and increased the likelihood of a child presenting with a bll 5 >= mu g/dl by a factor of 1.91-3.50, implying an additional 561 children exceeding 5 mu g/dl. we conservatively estimate cohort social costs (through lost earnings alone) of this increase in water-lead exposed children at $65 million, contrasted with expected annual savings of $2 million from switching water source. on the switch from phase b to c, we find blls decreased about 50% from their initial rise following boil water advisories and subsequent water avoidance behaviors by households. finally, the return to the baseline source water (phase d) returned child blls to pre-fwc levels further implicating water-lead exposure as a causal source of child blls throughout the fwc.",nongeographical,michigan,0,Flint,policy,residential,NA
biogeochemical characterization of municipal compost to support urban agriculture and limit childhood lead exposure from resuspended urban soils,"chronic low-level lead exposure among low-income minority children is an urgent environmental justice issue. addressing this ubiquitous urban public health crisis requires a new transdisciplinary paradigm. the primary goals of this work are to inform best practices for urban gardeners working in lead contaminated soils and to reimagine urban organic waste management schemes to produce compost, which when covering or mixed with urban soil, could minimize lead exposure. we investigate bulk and bioaccessible lead from five types of compost used in urban gardens in boston, ma. we categorized them by feedstock and measured bulk elemental concentrations and physical characteristics. our results show that different feedstocks exhibit unique geochemical fingerprints. while bulk lead concentrations in compost are a fraction of what is typical for urban soils, the bioaccessible lead fraction in compost is greater than the default parameters for the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (ieubk) model. the lack of geochemical differences across feedstocks for lead sorption to carbon indicates a similar sorption mechanism for all compost. this suggests that municipal compost would be suitable for capping lead contaminated urban soils. risk assessment models should consider lead bioaccessibility, to prevent the underprediction of exposure risk, and should include compost along with soils as urban matrices. based on the observed bioaccessibility in our compost samples, 170 mg/kg total lead in compost will yield the same bioaccessible lead as the ieubk model predicts for the 400 mg/kg epa soil lead benchmark. local logistical challenges remain for interdisciplinary teams of city planners, exposure scientists, and urban agricultural communities to design organic waste collection practices to produce compost that will support urban agriculture and primary lead exposure prevention.",nongeographical,massachusetts,0,"Boston, MA",environment,environment,NA

"the influence of lead content in drinking water, household dust, soil, and paint on blood lead levels of children in flin flon, manitoba and creighton, saskatchewan","lead exposure continues to be an important health issue despite the general removal of lead sources in commercial and industrial applications. low levels of lead exposure have been found to produce adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children with no evidence that a threshold exists for this critical endpoint. blood lead levels (blls) were measured in children (n=118) under the age of 7years in the northern canadian smelter community of flin flon, manitoba and creighton, saskatchewan. an environmental sampling component was included to examine the relationship between lead content in outdoor soil, household dust, tap water, and paint within a given household and the corresponding blls in participating children. the geometric mean (gm) bll for study participants was 1.41μg/dl. blood lead levels varied slightly by age category with the lowest levels found among the children under age 2 (gm=1.11μg/dl) and the highest levels found among children between 2 and 3years of age (gm=1.98μg/dl). results from the multivariate modeling indicated that blls had a significant positive association with the age of housing (p<0.05), with children living in households constructed prior to 1945 being more likely to have higher levels (p=0.034). outdoor soil (gm=74.7μg/g), household dust from kitchen floors (gm=1.34μg/ft(2)), and maximum household lead paint were found to be significantly correlated (p<0.05) to blls. although a statistically significant association between concentrations of lead in these household media and the corresponding blls exists, the variability in blls was poorly explained by these factors alone (r(2)=0.07, 0.12 and 0.06 for soil, household dust, and paint, respectively). lead concentrations in flushed (gm=0.89μg/l) and stagnant (gm=2.07μg/l and 1.18μg/l) tap water samples were not significantly correlated (p>0.05) to blls.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
from lead exposure in early childhood to adolescent health: a chicago birth cohort,"objectives: to assess the relationships between childhood lead exposure and 3 domains of later adolescent health: mental, physical, and behavioral. methods: we followed a random sample of birth cohort members from the project on human development in chicago neighborhoods, recruited in 1995 to 1997, to age 17 years and matched to childhood blood test results from the department of public health. we used ordinary least squares regression, coarsened exact matching, and instrumental variables to assess the relationship between average blood lead levels in childhood and impulsivity, anxiety or depression, and body mass index in adolescence. all models adjusted for relevant individual, household, and neighborhood characteristics. results: after adjustment, a 1 microgram per deciliter increase in average childhood blood lead level significantly predicts 0.06 (95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.01, 0.12) and 0.09 (95% ci = 0.03, 0.16) sd increases and a 0.37 (95% ci = 0.11, 0.64) point increase in adolescent impulsivity, anxiety or depression, and body mass index, respectively, following ordinary least squares regression. results following matching and instrumental variable strategies are very similar. conclusions: childhood lead exposure undermines adolescent well-being, with implications for the persistence of racial and class inequalities, considering structural patterns of initial exposure.",nongeographical,illinois,0,Chicago,achievement,health outcome,NA
geospatial evaluation of lead bioaccessibility and distribution for site specific prediction of threshold limits,"recent work identified the need for site-specific pb bioaccessibility evaluation and scaled contaminant modeling. pb heterogeneity has made bioaccessibility characterization difficult, and complicated distribution models. using field testing, bioaccessibility measurement, integrated exposure uptake and biokinetic (ieubk) modeling, and geospatial techniques, we propose a framework for conducting applied risk-based, multiscale assessment. this framework was tested and implemented in burlington, vt, an area of old housing stock and high pb burden (up to 15 000 mg kg(-1)) derived primarily from paint. after analyzing local soil samples for total and bioaccessible pb, it was determined that bioaccessible and total pb were well correlated in this area, through which an average bioaccessibility parameter was derived approximating pb bioaccessibility for this soil type and pb impact. this parameter was used with the ieubk to recommend the local limit for residential soil pb be reduced from 400 to 360 mg kg(-1), taking into consideration the lowering of the blood lead level threshold for pb poisoning from 10 to 514 mu g dl(-1) by the centers for disease control (cdc). geospatial investigation incorporated samples collected during this investigation and samples from a high school summer science academy, and relied on three techniques, used at different scales: kriging of total and background pb alone, kriging of total and background pb with housing age as a well-sampled, well-correlated secondary variable (cokriging), and inverse distance weighting of total and bioaccessible pb. modeling at different scales allowed for characterization of pb impact at single sites as well as citywide. model maps show positive correlation between areas of older housing and areas of high pb burden, as well as potential at different scales for reducing the effects of pb heterogeneity.

effectiveness of prevailing flush guidelines to prevent exposure to lead in tap water,"flushing tap water is promoted as a low cost approach to reducing water lead exposures. this study evaluated lead reduction when prevailing flush guidelines (30 s-2 min) are implemented in a city compliant with lead-associated water regulations (new orleans, la, usa). water samples (n = 1497) collected from a convenience sample of 376 residential sites (2015-2017) were analyzed for lead. samples were collected at (1) first draw (n = 375) and after incremental flushes of (2) 30-45 s (n = 375); (3) 2.5-3 min (n = 373), and (4) 5.5-6 min (n = 218). there was a small but significant increase in water lead after the 30 s flush (vs. first draw lead). there was no significant lead reduction until the 6 min flush (p < 0.05); but of these samples, 52% still had detectable lead (>= 1 ppb). older homes (pre-1950) and low occupancy sites had significantly higher water lead (p < 0.05). each sample type had health-based standard exceedances in over 50% of sites sampled (max: 58 ppb). while flushing may be an effective short-term approach to remediate high lead, prevailing flush recommendations are an inconsistently effective exposure prevention measure that may inadvertently increase exposures. public health messages should be modified to ensure appropriate application of flushing, while acknowledging its short-comings and practical limitations.",louisiana,louisiana,1,,structure,residential,indoor
evaluating water lead levels during the flint water crisis,"in april 2014, the drinking water source in flint, michigan was switched from lake huron water with phosphate inhibitors to flint river water without corrosion inhibitors. the absence of corrosion control and use of a more corrosive source increased lead leaching from plumbing. our city-wide citizen science water lead results contradicted official claims that there was no problem- our 90th percentile was 26.8 mu g/l, which was almost double the lead and copper rule action level of 15 mu g/l. back calculations of a lcr sampling pool with 50% lead pipes indicated an estimated 90th percentile lead value of 31.7 mu g/l (+/- 4.3 mu g/l). four subsequent sampling efforts were conducted to track reductions in water lead after the switch back to lake huron water and enhanced corrosion control. the incidence of water lead varied by service line material. between august 2015 and november 2016, median water lead reduced from 3.0 to <1 mu g/l for homes with copper service lines, 7.2-1.9 mu g/l with galvanized service lines, and 9.9-2.3 mu g/l with lead service lines. as of summer 2017, our 90th percentile of 7.9 mu g/l no longer differed from official results, which indicated flint's water lead levels were below the action level.",michigan,michigan,1,,infrastructure,residential,indoor
effect of residential lead-hazard interventions on childhood blood lead concentrations and neurobehavioral outcomes: a randomized clinical trial,"importance: childhood lead exposure is associated with neurobehavioral deficits. the effect of a residential lead hazard intervention on blood lead concentrations and neurobehavioral development remains unknown. objective: to determine whether a comprehensive residential lead-exposure reduction intervention completed during pregnancy could decrease residential dust lead loadings, prevent elevated blood lead concentrations, and improve childhood neurobehavioral outcomes. design, setting, and participants: this longitudinal, community-based randomized clinical trial of pregnant women and their children, the health outcomes and measures of the environment (home) study, was conducted between march 1, 2003, and january 31, 2006. pregnant women attending 1 of 9 prenatal care clinics affiliated with 3 hospitals in the cincinnati, ohio, metropolitan area were recruited. of the 1263 eligible women, 468 (37.0%) agreed to participate and 355 women (75.8%) were randomized in this intention-to-treat analysis. participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 interventions designed to reduce residential lead or injury hazards. follow-up on children took place at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age. data analysis was performed from september 2, 2017, to may 6, 2018. main outcomes and measures: residential dust lead loadings were measured at baseline and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age, the children's blood lead concentrations as well as behavior, cognition, and executive functions were assessed. results: of the 355 women randomized, 174 (49.0%) were assigned to the intervention group (mean [sd] age at delivery, 30.1 (5.5) years; 119 [68.3%] self-identified as non-hispanic white) and 181 (50.9%) to the control group (mean [sd] age at delivery, 29.2 [5.7] years; 123 [67.9%] self-identified as non-hispanic white). the intervention reduced the dust lead loadings for the floor (24%; 95% ci, -43% to 1%), windowsill (40%; 95% ci, -60% to -11%), and window trough (47%; 95% ci, -68% to -10%) surfaces. the intervention did not statistically significantly reduce childhood blood lead concentrations (-6%; 95% ci, -17% to 6%; p = .29). neurobehavioral test scores were not statistically different between children in the intervention group than those in the control group except for a reduction in anxiety scores in the intervention group (β = -1.6; 95% ci, -3.2 to -0.1; p = .04). conclusions and relevance: residential lead exposures, as well as blood lead concentrations in non-hispanic black children, were reduced through a comprehensive lead-hazard intervention without elevating the lead body burden. however, this decrease did not result in substantive neurobehavioral improvements in children. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00129324.",ohio,ohio,1,,achievement,residential,indoor
advocating for automatic eligibility for early intervention services for children exposed to lead,"lead poisoning remains one of the most prevalent and preventable environmental health hazards affecting children. low-level lead exposure has been shown to significantly increase the risk of learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and developmental delay. it also has substantial social implications as lead toxicity disproportionately affects children from low-income, ethnic minority households. early intervention (ei) is a state-based federal program (part c of the federal individuals with disabilities education act) created to support the development of children from birth to age 3 years who are experiencing or who are at risk for developmental delay. in 2016, an illinois ei and lead workgroup was established to address the best practice of offering ei services to children who have been exposed to lead. this work serves as a template for advocates and health providers in other states to establish automatic eligibility for ei services at low levels of lead exposure, while also demonstrating the capacity to serve these children without overwhelming the state's ei system.",illinois,illinois,1,,policy,policy,NA
"global and geographically weighted quantile regression for modeling the incident rate of children's lead poisoning in syracuse, ny, usa","objective: the purpose of this study was to explore the full distribution of children's lead poisoning and identify high risk locations or areas in the neighborhood of the inner city of syracuse (ny, usa), using quantile regression models. methods: global quantile regression (qr) and geographically weighted quantile regression (gwqr) were applied to model the relationships between children's lead poisoning and three environmental factors at different quantiles (25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th). the response variable was the incident rate of children's blood lead level >= 5 mu g/dl in each census block, and the three predictor variables included building year, town taxable values, and soil lead concentration. results: at each quantile, the regression coefficients of both global qr and gwqr models were (1) negative for both building year and town taxable values, indicating that the incident rate of children lead poisoning reduced with newer buildings and/or higher taxable values of the houses; and (2) positive for the soil lead concentration, implying that higher soil lead concentration around the house may cause higher risks of children's lead poisoning. further, these negative or positive relationships between children's lead poisoning and three environmental factors became stronger for larger quantiles (i.e., higher risks). conclusions: the gwqr models enabled us to explore the full distribution of children's lead poisoning and identify high risk locations or areas in the neighborhood of the inner city of syracuse, which would provide useful information to assist the government agencies to make better decisions on where and what the lead hazard treatment should focus on.",new york,new york,1,,screening,environment,outdoor
"a comparison of child blood lead levels in urban and rural children ages 5-12 years living in the border region of el paso, texas","lead exposure is an unresolved pediatric health risk and disproportionately affects children in lower-income neighborhoods. residences with children younger than age 5 years are the focus of mitigation policies; however, studies have shown that older children between the ages of 5 and 12 years also are at risk of central nervous system effects. whether historically contaminated neighborhoods present ongoing risk to older children also is of concern. this study compared the blood lead levels (blls) of older children from an historically contaminated urban neighborhood to those of demographically matched children from a nearby rural locale and predicted significantly higher blls in the urban children. the study included 222 children aged 5-12 years, 111 from the urban neighborhood and 111 from local rural townships, matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and family income. blood lead, cadmium, and mercury were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. general linear models tested whether geographic location (urban vs. rural) predicted child heavy metal levels, controlling for sex and age. only location predicted only child bll (r(2)= 0.36); children living in the urban setting had significantly higher blls as compared with matched rural township children (f = 125, df(220,2), p <0.001). neighborhoods with a history of lead contamination can present current risk of lead exposure for older children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as well as for infants and toddlers. more studies are needed to better characterize the risk of lead exposure to older children, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods with a history of lead contamination.",texas,texas,1,,sociodemographic,environment,NA

"preliminary assessment of lead concentrations in topsoil of 100 parks in los angeles, california","los angeles has a long history of lead (pb) contamination due to automobile emissions, industrial processes, and pb-containing paint. although the amount of pb coming from these sources has been reduced or eliminated, exposure to pb-contaminated soil is still a concern. contaminated soil in urban parks may constitute an important exposure route, since children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of pb. while the current epa clean up level is 400 parts per million (ppm) in recreational and residential areas, the office of environmental health hazard assessment (oehha) of california revised the soil-screening level to 80 ppm, based on a 1 mu g/dl increase of blood level that children experience. in this work, top soil samples in triplicate were taken from each of 100 urban parks in los angeles and analyzed to determine pb concentrations and soil properties. results show that the average pb concentration in park soil was 65.5 ppm (range: 0.969-363 ppm), with 35 parks exceeding the california guideline of 80 ppm based on the average pb concentration measured at each park. pb concentrations in 42 parks exceeded the background value of 19.7 ppm (by a factor of 3-17). however, variation in measured levels of pb within most parks was high ( > 10% rsd in 89 parks). parks containing elevated pb concentrations in soil were distributed across many areas of los angeles, including central los angeles, beverly hills, inglewood, and central alameda. children might potentially suffer from an estimated 1-4 mu g/dl increase of blood pb level according to leadspread model. pb concentrations did not significantly correlate with most soil properties, except for silt (rho = 0.226, p = 0.012). additionally, soil from sandy loam contained significantly higher pb concentrations as compared to soil from loamy sand (p = 0.008). pb concentrations were significantly correlated with park age (rho = - 0.319, p = 0.033) and were generally lower in areas located away from major roads. monitoring of parks with high levels of pb as well as investigation of unexamined regions in los angeles are needed.",california,california,1,,environment,environment,outdoor

effects of ortho- and polyphosphates on lead speciation in drinking water,"lead is a potent neurotoxin and drinking water represents an important route of exposure, especially where legacy lead pipe is widespread. polyphosphates are often added to drinking water to sequester iron and calcium, but they may form coordination complexes with lead, increasing its solubility. this risk is not well characterized in practice: the prevalence of lead-polyphosphate complexes in drinking water systems is not known. we used size-exclusion chromatography (sec) with multi-element (icp-ms) detection to compare the speciation of lead below 0.45 p.m in two low-alkalinity water systems dosing phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors at different ortho: poly ratios and doses. in one system dosing polyphosphate at 0.05 mg p l-1 (3:1 ratio), it reverted almost completely to orthophosphate during distribution. in another system dosing polyphosphate at 0.20 mg p l-1 (1:1 ratio), it was detectable at points of use. under the influence of polyphosphate, lead and iron were present as dissolved species strongly associated with phosphorus. moreover, experiments with sodium hexametaphosphate confirmed our ability to detect lead as a coordination complex using sec. in the absence of polyphosphate, lead and iron were present as colloidal particles. orthophosphate on its own also appeared to reduce lead solubility, as estimated using paired sample profiles collected at seventeen single-unit residences. increasing orthophosphate from 0.5 to 1.0 mg po4 l-1 accompanied decreases in total lead concentrations of 38% (95% ci: 15-51%) within eight months. analysis of recovered lead pipe corrosion scale was consistent with the presence of an insoluble lead phosphate compound: hydroxypyromorphite (pb-5(po4)(3)oh).",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

lead levels at the tap and consumer exposure from legacy and recent lead service line replacements in six utilities,"profile, regulatory, and investigative sampling were completed in six utilities to study the impact of partial and full lead service line replacements (lslrs) on water lead levels (wlls) and consumer's exposure. as compared to households with no replacement, lead release after partial lslr (plslr) was generally greater in the short term (3-50 days), and comparable or lower in the medium (<2 years) and long-term (>2 years). this was mainly explained by insufficient time elapsed to stabilize scales after disturbances to the service line. one utility showed sustained lead release over 18 months after plslr. moreover, the reduction in wlls was small when analyzing results for the same households. as a comparison, full lslr decreased wlls drastically and immediately. the occurrence of low (0-5 mu g/l) to high (>= 50 mu g/l) wlls in the profiles varied between households and reflected the variability of exposure among households in the same system. using this probability of occurrence, the distribution of wlls of exposure was estimated for households with or without a plslr, and used to model young children blood lead levels (blls) for both groups of households. the range of modeled blls decreased slightly for households with plslr, but still overlapped the range estimated for households with no replacement. this analysis suggests that, in a system, plslrs do not reduce young children blood lead levels except in a fraction of households.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
potential challenges meeting the american academy of pediatrics’ lead in school drinking water goal of 1 μg/l,"concern about lead in drinking water has heightened since the flint water crisis. moreover, recent medical evidence increasingly shows damage to children’s health at levels of lead exposure once considered low. in order to better protect children from these hazards, the american academy of pediatrics (aap) recommends that drinking water in public schools does not exceed 1 μg/l lead. meeting this goal with current plumbing and fixtures will be challenging, because current “lead-free” standards did not anticipate targets this low. three styles of recently manufactured “lead-free” faucets were tested and average lead leaching ranged from 1.5 μg/l to 3.0 μg/l after 19 d. given that the nsf/ansi 61 test water is less aggressive than some potable waters, even newly manufactured “lead-free” faucets may not meet the standards recommended by aap.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,"Mentions Flint, MI but not focus",,,
"sampling in schools and large institutional buildings: implications for regulations, exposure and management of lead and copper","legacy lead and copper components are ubiquitous in plumbing of large buildings including schools that serve children most vulnerable to lead exposure. lead and copper samples must be collected after varying stagnation times and interpreted in reference to different thresholds. a total of 130 outlets (fountains, bathroom and kitchen taps) were sampled for dissolved and particulate lead as well as copper. sampling was conducted at 8 schools and 3 institutional (non-residential) buildings served by municipal water of varying corrosivity, with and without corrosion control (cc), and without a lead service line. samples included first draw following overnight stagnation (>8h), partial (30 s) and fully (5 min) flushed, and first draw after 30 min of stagnation. total lead concentrations in first draw samples after overnight stagnation varied widely from 0.07 to 19.9 mu g pb/l (median: 1.7 mu g pb/l) for large buildings served with non-corrosive water. higher concentrations were observed in schools with corrosive water without cc (0.9-201 mu g pb/l, median: 14.3 mu g pb/l), while levels in schools with cc ranged from 0.2 to 45.1 mu g pb/l (median: 2.1 mu g pb/l). partial flushing (30 s) and full flushing (5 min) reduced concentrations by 88% and 92% respectively for corrosive waters without cc. lead concentrations were <10 mu g pb/l in all samples following 5 min of flushing. however, after only 30 min of stagnation, first draw concentrations increased back to >45% than values in 1st draw samples collected after overnight stagnation. concentrations of particulate pb varied widely (>= 0.02-846 mu g pb/l) and was found to be the cause of very high total pb concentrations in the 2% of samples exceeding 50 mu g pb/l. pb levels across outlets within the same building varied widely (up to 1000x) especially in corrosive water (0.85 -851 mu g pb/l after 30ms) confirming the need to sample at each outlet to identify high risk taps. based on the much higher concentrations observed in first draw samples, even after a short stagnation, the first 250ml should be discarded unless no sources of lead are present. results question the cost-benefit of daily or weekly flushing as a remediation strategy. as such, current regulatory requirements may fail to protect children as they may not identify problematic taps and effective mitigation measures.

cost-benefit analysis for a lead wheel weight phase-out in canada,"lead wheel weights (lwws) have been banned in europe, and some us states, but they continue to dominate the market in canada. exposure to lead is associated with numerous health impacts and can result in multiple and irreversible health problems which include cognitive impairment when exposure occurs during early development. such impacts incur high individual and social costs. the purpose of this study was to assess the costs and public health benefits of a risk management strategy (rms) that would result from a lww phase-out in canada and compare this to a business-as-usual (bau) scenario. the contribution of lwws to lead concentrations in media including roadway soil/dust, ambient and indoor air, and indoor dust were estimated. the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children (ieubk) was used to develop estimates for the blood lead levels (blls) in children (mu g/dl) associated with the bau and the rms. the blls estimated via the ieubk model were then used to assess the iq decrements associated with the bau that would be avoided under the rms. the subsequent overall societal benefits in terms of increased lifetime earning potential and reduced crime rate, were then estimated and compared to industry and government costs. lwws form 72% of the canadian wheel weight market and n1500 tonnes of lead as new lwws attached to vehicles enters canadian society annually. we estimate that 110-131 tonnes of lead in detached wws are abraded on road ways in canada each year. a lww phase-out was predicted to result in a drop in pre-school blls of up to 0.4 mu g/dl. the estimated net benefits associated with the rms based on cognitive decrements avoided and hence increased lifetime earning potential (increased productivity) and reduced crime are expected to be: c$248 million (8% discount rate) to c$1.2 billion (3% discount rate) per year.

lead exposure to children from consumption of backyard chicken eggs,"backyard chicken ownership is rapidly increasing in urban areas in the united states, largely as a way to provide eggs for household consumption. despite elevated levels of environmental lead contamination in many us cities, the role of backyard chicken eggs as a pathway for lead exposure, particularly for children, has received limited scrutiny. to characterize lead exposure from consumption of backyard chicken eggs for children and predict related effects on blood lead level (bll), we conducted a cross-sectional study of backyard chicken owners in the greater boston area (n = 51). we interviewed participants regarding egg consumption by household members and collected backyard eggs (n = 201) and coop soil samples (n = 48) for analysis. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms) was used to evaluate lead concentration in homogenized eggs and an x-ray fluorescence (xrf) portable device was used to assess soil lead levels in the laboratory. we used the usepa's integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children (ieubk) to assess the relative contribution of backyard egg consumption to aggregate bll in children. four scenarios were developed in the ieubk model to address variability in egg consumption rates and egg lead contamination. lead was detected in egg samples from 98% of the households that provided egg samples. mean household lead concentration was 0.10 μg/g (sd: 0.18). egg lead concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection (0.0014 μg/g) to 1.798 μg/g (<1.4-1198 ppb). egg lead levels were strongly positively correlated with lead concentration in coop soil (r = 0.64; p < 0.001). in modeled scenarios where a child < 7 years frequently ate eggs highly contaminated with lead, blls are predicted to increase by 0.9-1.5 μg/dl. in three other scenarios reflecting more moderate egg lead contamination and consumption rates, blls were predicted to increase from 0.1 to 0.8 μg/dl. consumption of backyard chicken eggs can contribute to lead exposure in children. soil lead remediation prior to chicken ownership may reduce lead exposure from backyard eggs.",nongeographical,massachusetts,0,Boston,nutrition,diet,NA
lead exposure from households and school settings: influence of diet on blood lead levels,"lead is known as a potent toxicant to human health, particularly for children while their central nervous system is developing. the aim of this study was to investigate the associations between blood lead levels (blls) and lead exposure in the children's diet, home, and school environments. a cross-sectional study was conducted with 153 children aged 1-4 years, in four day care centers (dccs), where a high prevalence of lead exposure was previously found. lead determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (gf-aas) was performed for venous blood, drinking water collected in the dccs, and the 24-h diet (n = 64). environmental screenings were conducted to evaluate lead concentrations in the tableware, buildings, and playground items in all dccs and children's homes (n = 18) by using a field-portable x-ray fluorescence analyzer (fp-xrf). the bll mean was 2.71 μg dl(-1). means for 24-h lead concentrations in the diet were 1.61 and 2.24 μg kg(-1) of body weight (bw) in two dccs. lead concentrations in the water supply were lower than 2 μg l(-1). more than 11% of the dccs' environmental analyses presented lead concentrations higher than or equal to 1 mg cm(-2), as defined by the usepa. the diet was not found to be a risk factor for lead exposure, but households and dcc settings raised concern. children's exposure to lead in dcc environments, where they spend the most part of their weekdays, appeared to be relevant. graphical abstract ᅟ.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
intake of lead (pb) from tap water of homes with leaded and low lead plumbing systems,"methods of quantifying consumer exposure to lead in drinking water are increasingly of interest worldwide, especially those that account for consumer drinking habits and the semi-random nature of water lead release from plumbing systems. a duplicate intake protocol was developed in which individuals took a sub-sample from each measured drink they consumed in the home over three days in both winter and summer. the protocol was applied in two different water company regional areas (wc1 and wc2), selected to represent high risk situations in england, with the presence or absence of lead service pipes or phosphate corrosion control. consumer exposure to lead was highest in properties with lead service pipes, served by water without p dosing. the protocol indicated that a small number of individuals in the study, all from homes with lead service pipes, consumed lead at levels that exceeded current guidance from the european food standards agency. children's potential blood lead levels (blls) were estimated using the internal exposure uptake biokinetic model (ieubk). the ieubk model predicted that up to 46% of children aged 0-7 years old may have elevated blls (>5 mu g/dl) when consuming the worst case drinking water quality (>99% ile). estimating blood lead levels using the ieubk model for more typical lead concentrations in drinking water identified in this study (between 0.1 and 7.1 mu g/l), predicts that elevated blls may affect a small proportion of children between 0 and 7 years old.

the state of public health lead policies: implications for urban health inequities and recommendations for health equity,"although lead has been removed from paint and gasoline sold in the u.s., lead exposures persist, with communities of color and residents in urban and low-income areas at greatest risk for exposure. the persistence of and inequities in lead exposures raise questions about the scope and implementation of policies that address lead as a public health concern. to understand the multi-level nature of lead policies, this paper and case study reviews lead policies at the national level, for the state of california, and for santa ana, ca, a dense urban city in southern california. through a community-academic partnership process, this analysis examines lead exposure pathways represented, the level of intervention (e.g., prevention, remediation), and whether policies address health inequities. results indicate that most national and state policies focus on establishing hazardous lead exposure levels in settings and consumer products, disclosing lead hazards, and remediating lead paint. several policies focus on mitigating exposures rather than primary prevention. the persistence of lead exposures indicates the need to identify sustainable solutions to prevent lead exposures in the first place. we close with recommendations to reduce lead exposures across the life course, consider multiple lead exposure pathways, and reduce and eliminate health inequities related to lead.",california,california,1,,sociodemographic,policy,NA
"assessment of child lead exposure in a philadelphia community, 2014","introduction: several urban neighborhoods in philadelphia, pennsylvania, have a history of soil, household lead paint, and potential lead-emitting industry contamination. objectives: to (1) describe blood lead levels (blls) in target neighborhoods, (2) identify risk factors and sources of lead exposure, (3) describe household environmental lead levels, and (4) compare results with existing data. methods: a simple, random, cross-sectional sampling strategy was used to enroll children 8 years or younger living in selected philadelphia neighborhoods with a history of lead-emitting industry during july 2014. geometric mean of child blls and prevalence of blls of 5 μg/dl or more were calculated. linear and logistic regression analyses were used to ascertain risk factors for elevated blls. results: among 104 children tested for blood lead, 13 (12.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 7.5-20.2) had blls of 5 μg/dl or more. the geometric mean bll was 2.0 μg/dl (95% ci, 1.7-2.3 μg/dl). higher geometric mean blls were significantly associated with front door entryway dust lead content, residence built prior to 1900, and a child currently or ever receiving medicaid. seventy-one percent of households exceeded the screening level for soil, 25% had an elevated front door floor dust lead level, 28% had an elevated child play area floor dust lead level, and 14% had an elevated interior window dust lead level. children in households with 2 to 3 elevated environmental lead samples were more likely to have blls of 5 μg/dl or more. a spatial relationship between household proximity to historic lead-emitting facilities and child bll was not identified. conclusion: entryway floor dust lead levels were strongly associated with blood lead levels in participants. results underscore the importance to make housing lead safe by addressing all lead hazards in and around the home. reduction of child lead exposure is crucial, and continued blood lead surveillance, testing, and inspection of homes of children with blls of 5 μg/dl or more to identify and control lead sources are recommended. pediatric health care providers can be especially vigilant screening medicaid-eligible/enrolled children and children living in very old housing.",pennsylvania,pennsylvania,1,,exploratory,residential,indoor
drinking water lead and socioeconomic factors as predictors of blood lead levels in new jersey's children between two time periods,"as blood lead levels have decreased over time, the relative contributions of alternative lead sources warrant further examination. much attention has been paid to the relative contribution of lead in drinking water, particularly after the discovery of contaminated drinking water in flint, michigan which has also renewed interest in the persistent socioeconomic and racial disparities in children's exposure to lead. as the environmental sources of lead exposure are shifting in importance over time, we decided to examine how demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors may confound or interact with each other, and whether these relationships have changed over time. the study population included all new jersey resident children aged 6-26 months with at least one blood lead specimen collected between 2000 and 2004 (n = 288,758) or 2010 and 2014 (n = 326,530). reported 90th percentile water lead data (in parts per billion) was summarized annually for each water system statewide. children's blood lead levels have decreased over time from a statewide geometric mean of 2.47 µg/dl (95% ci 2.46, 2.48) between 2000 and 2004 to 1.57 µg/dl (95% ci 1.57, 1.57) between 2010 and 2014. individual-level factors of child's age and season of blood draw and area-based measures of race, older housing, and poverty were predictors of children's blood lead levels. conclusions regarding area-based measure of hispanic ethnicity are limited and require further research. the narrow range and low levels of area-based lead concentrations in drinking water limits the ability to detect associations with blood lead levels. racial disparities in blood lead continue to persist but economic disparities may be narrowing as blood lead concentrations continue to decline.",NA,new jersey,0,,environment,sociodemographic,NA

variability in the spatial density of vacant properties contributes to background lead (pb) exposure in children,"background: heightened blood lead levels (bll) are associated with cognitive deficiencies and adverse behavioral outcomes. lead-contaminated house dust is the primary source of exposure in u.s. children, and evidence suggests that even background (low-level) exposure has negative consequences. identifying sources of background exposure is of great public health significance because of the larger number of children that can be affected. methods: blood lead was assessed in a bi-racial sample of children from syracuse, ny, aged 9-11, using established biomonitoring methods. the spatial density of vacant properties was modelled from publicly available georeferenced datasets. further, regression models were used to measure the impact of this spatial density variable on children's bll. results: in a sample of 221 children, with a mean bll of 1.06 mu g/dl (sd = 0.68), results showed increases in spatial density of vacant properties predict increases in median blood-pb levels, b = 0.14 (0.06-0.21), p < .001. this association held true even after accounting for demographic covariates, and age of individual housing. further analysis showed spatial autocorrelation of the residuals changed from a clustered pattern to a random pattern once the spatial density variable was introduced to the model. discussion: this study is the first to identify a background-lead exposure source using spatial density modelling. as vacant properties deteriorate, lead-contaminated dust likely disperses into the surrounding environment. high-density areas have an accumulation of lead hazards in environmental media, namely soil and dust, putting more children at risk of exposure.",new york,new york,1,,sociodemographic,environment,both

"pou water filters effectively reduce lead in drinking water: a demonstration field study in flint, michigan","a field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of faucet-mounted point of use (pou) water filters for removing high concentrations of lead in drinking water from premise plumbing sources and lead service lines (lsl). these filters were concurrently certified for total lead removal under nsf/ansi standard 53 (nsf/ansi-53) and for fine particulate (class i) reduction under nsf/ansi standard 42 (nsf/ansi-42). in 2016, filtered and unfiltered drinking water samples were collected at over 345 locations in flint, michigan. over 97% of filtered water samples contained lead below 0.5 mu g/l. the maximum lead concentration in filtered water was 2.9 mu g/l, well below the bottled water standard. the effectiveness of the pou activated carbon block filters in reducing lead concentrations, even above the 150 mu g/l nsf/ansi-53 challenge standard, is likely related to trapping particles due to the small effective pore size of the filters, in addition to ion-exchange or sorption removal of soluble lead. properly installed and maintained pou filters, certified under both nsf/ansi-53 (for total lead) and nsf/ansi-42 (for fine particulate), can protect all populations, including pregnant women and children, by reducing lead in drinking water to levels that would not result in a significant increase in overall lead exposure.",michigan,michigan,1,,prevention,water treatment,indoor
cost-benefit of point-of-use devices for lead reduction,"background: lead exposure represents a significant human health concern that often occurs with little warning to the consumer. water lead levels can be mitigated by point-of-use (pou) devices such as reverse osmosis, distillation, or activated carbon with lead reduction media. objectives: this study assessed a partial cost-benefit of residential installation of pou devices to reduce lead concentrations in drinking water and examined the economic impact at the community level based on exposures reported in flint, michigan. methods: we calculated the individual consumer breakeven point for each lead abatement option by subtracting the lifetime cost of device installation and maintenance from the lifetime cost of lead exposure through its impact on intelligence (iq) and lifetime earnings. this approach was then extrapolated to the community level based on reported lead exposures in flint, michigan. results: based on operating pou device costs, lead absorption from water, and economic losses associated with reduced iq, initial water lead levels associated with consumer breakeven points for reverse osmosis (7.31 mu g/l), activated carbon (3.73 mu g/l), and distillation (12.0 mu g/l) were calculated. for example, an individual consuming water with 25 mu g/l of lead, similar to the 90th percentile of concentrations measured in flint, michigan, would have an expected blood lead level of 1.25 mu g/dl, a corresponding loss of 0.641 iq points, and a lifetime economic earnings loss of $14,284. over 70 years of continued use, activated carbon with lead reduction media is the least expensive device to maintain and operate as compared to reverse osmosis and distillation. conclusions: infrastructure failures related to drinking water are unpredictable and exposure to contaminates can have significant economic ramifications. pou devices represent a cost-effective option to reduce the impact of lead exposure, particularly when water lead concentrations exceed regulated levels.",michigan,michigan,1,,prevention,water treatment,NA

compliance with mandated testing for lead in drinking water in school districts in new jersey,"preventing lead exposure from all sources is critical for children's optimal health and development. the crisis in flint, michigan, drew attention to the role of drinking water in lead exposure. school drinking water might pose significant risks due to aging infrastructure and the particular conditions of water use in schools. in 2016, new jersey mandated that school districts test all drinking water outlets for lead and specified procedures that districts must follow. this study assessed compliance with this mandate. districts were required to report results on their websites, so we used district websites as the unit of analysis to assess compliance with testing and reporting procedures and to identify schools that had reported maximum concentrations of lead in water. most districts complied with the mandate to test their drinking water (90%) and the majority complied with online reporting requirements to some extent (87%). most districts (79%) had one or more outlets in their district that exceeded the u.s. environmental protection agency's action level of 15 ppb. mandated testing for lead in drinking water in schools is an important policy that can prevent childhood lead exposure. new jersey should consider lowering the action level at which lead in drinking water should be remediated.",NA,new jersey,0,,screening,school,indoor

first trimester maternal exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals and fetal size in the michigan mother-infant pairs study,"exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals are near ubiquitous worldwide, and their potential impact on children is a major public health concern. this pilot study was designed to characterize exposures to phthalates, phenols and metals among pregnant women in the first trimester, and to examine associations with fetal biometrics and birth weight. a total of 41 chemicals and elements were analyzed in urine from 56 mothers with full-term newborns from the michigan mother-infant pairs study. bivariate analyses identified predictors of exposure biomarkers. associations between birth weight, fenton z-scores and second trimester fetal biometrics with toxicants were examined via multivariable linear regression. an average of 30 toxicants were detected in maternal urine. fast food consumption was associated with several phthalate metabolites, phenols and metals, and canned food consumption with bisphenol f (p <0.05). mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate was significantly associated with higher birth weight and fenton z-score while the opposite was observed for bisphenol s. estimated femur length from ultrasonography was significantly inversely associated with arsenic, barium and lead. while limited by sample size, this study is one of the first to evaluate birth outcomes with respect to emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals and to examine associations between toxicants and fetal biometrics. exposure assessment was provided by the national institute of environmental health sciences' children's health exposure analysis resource (niehs chear), a resource available to children's studies with the goal of combining data across cohorts in an effort to characterize the impact of toxicants on child health from birth and beyond.",michigan,michigan,1,,maternity,prenatal,NA
using birth cohort data to estimate prenatal chemical exposures for all births around the new bedford harbor superfund site in massachusetts,"background: children born near new bedford, massachusetts, have been prenatally exposed to multiple environmental chemicals, in part due to an older housing stock, maternal diet, and proximity to the new bedford harbor (nbh) superfund site. chemical exposure measures are not available for all births, limiting epidemiologic investigations and potential interventions. objective: we linked biomonitoring data from the new bedford cohort (nbc) and birth record data to predict prenatal exposures for all contemporaneous area births. methods: we used prenatal exposure biomarker data from the nbc, a population-based cohort of 788 mother–infant pairs born during 1993–1998 to mothers living near the nbh, linked to their corresponding massachusetts birth record data, to build predictive models for cord serum polychlorinated biphenyls (expressed as a sum,σpcbs ), p , p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (dde), hexachlorobenzene (hcb), cord blood lead (pb), and maternal hair mercury (hg). we applied the best fit models (highest pseudo r 2 ), with multivariable smooths of continuous variables, to predict exposure biomarkers for all 10,270 births during 1993–1998 around the nbh. we used 10-fold cross validation to validate the exposure models and the bootstrap method to characterize sampling variability in the exposure predictions. results: the 10-fold cross-validated r 2 for theσpcbs , dde, hcb, pb, and hg exposure models were 0.54, 0.40, 0.34, 0.46, and 0.40, respectively. for each exposure model, multivariable smooths of continuous variables improved the fit compared with linear models. other variables with significant effects on exposure estimates were paternal education, maternal race/ethnicity, and maternal ancestry. the resulting exposure predictions for all births had variability consistent with the nbc measured exposures. conclusions: predictive models using multivariable smoothing explained reasonable amounts of variance in prenatal exposure biomarkers. our analyses suggest that prenatal chemical exposures can be predicted for all contemporaneous births in the same geographic area by modeling available biomarker data for a subset of that population.",massachusetts,massachusetts,1,,environment,prenatal,NA
bayesian deprivation index models for explaining variation in elevated blood lead levels among children in maryland,"lead exposure adversely affects children's health. exposure in the united states is highest among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals who disproportionately live in substandard housing. we used bayesian binomial regression models to estimate a neighborhood deprivation index and its association with elevated blood lead level (ebll) risk using blood lead level testing data in maryland census tracts. our results show the probability of ebll was spatially structured with high values in baltimore city and low values in the district of columbia suburbs and baltimore suburbs. the association between the neighborhood deprivation index and ebll risk was statistically significant after accounting for spatial dependence in probability of ebll. the percent of houses built before 1940, african americans, and renter occupied housing were the most important variables in the index. bayesian models provide a flexible one-step approach to modeling risk associated with neighborhood deprivation while accounting for spatially structured and unstructured heterogeneity in risk.",maryland,maryland,1,,screening,sociodemographic,NA
"analysis of blood lead levels of young children in flint, michigan before and during the 18-month switch to flint river water","background: the toxicity of lead, like any xenobiotic, is directly linked to the duration of exposure and toxin concentration in the body. the elevation in blood lead levels (blls) in young flint, michigan children noted in time-periods before, and during the 18-month exposure to flint river water (frw) from 25 april 2014 to 15 october 2015 is well-known internationally. the length of time blls were elevated is unknown, yet key in understanding the potential health impact of the event. the objective of this study was to evaluate whether blls in flint children were increased during the entire 18-month frw exposure compared to similar earlier time periods. methods: we conducted a retrospective study analyzing blls from flint children aged 5 years and under. the geometric mean (gm) blls and percentages of blls ≥5.0 μg/dl in period i: 25 april 2006 to 15 october 2007 (earliest timeframe available for study) and period ii: 25 april 2012 to 15 october 2013 (timeframe immediately before the water switch), were compared to period iii, 25 april 2014 to 15 october 2015 (frw exposure). results: there were 5663 blls available for study. gm ± se blls decreased from 2.19 ± 0.03 μg/dl in period i to 1.47 ± 0.02 μg/dl in period ii [95% ci, 0.64, 0.79]; p<.001 and decreased further to 1.32 ± 0.02 µg/dl during the frw period iii [95% ci, 0.79, 0.95]; p<.001. the percentage of blls ≥5.0 μg/dl decreased from period i (10.6%) to period ii (3.3%) [95% ci, 5.7, 8.8]; p<.001 and from period i to period iii (3.9%) [95% ci, 5.0, 8.2]; p=.002. the 0.6% increase from period ii to period iii was not statistically significant [95% ci, -1.9, 0.57]; p=.30. conclusion: analyses of gm and percentages ≥5.0 μg/dl of blls do not support the occurrence of a global increase in blls in young children of flint during the entire 18-month period of frw exposure.",michigan,michigan,1,,exploratory,screening,NA

"lead release to potable water during the flint, michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data","routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-flint water crisis (fwc). the mass of potable plumbing-related metals ( i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the fwc (p < 0.05). a simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (wll90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts august 2015-august 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [biosolids-pb (kg) = 0.483 x wll90 (mu g/l) + 1.79: r-2 = 0.86, p < 0.05]. although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the fwc versus the comparable time pre-fwc, 76% of that increase occurred in july -september 2014, and the corresponding percentage of flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead >= 5 mu g/dl (i.e., %ebl5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p < 0.05). %ebl5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the fwc compared to prefwc or post-fwc. as expected, lead in biosolids during the fwc, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (r-2 = 0.30, p < 0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-fwc when orthophosphate was present. tripling the orthophosphate dose post-fwc versus pre-fwc and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %ebls) to historic lows (2016-2017 vs. 2012-2013; p < 0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure.

the cdc blood lead reference value for children: time for a change,"the purpose of this article is to consider alternate uses of the blood lead reference value for children. there are two possible approaches. historically the reference value has been used to guide clinical and public interventions for individual children. as the distribution of blood lead levels in the population has been lowered over time, the blood lead level at which interventions are recommended has also been reduced. the use of a reference value of 3.5 μg/dl, based on the 98 percentile of blood lead levels for children in 2011–2014 national health and nutrition examination survey is under review. for several reasons, adopting the new reference value to guide clinical and public health management puts practitioners in an untenable position. first, the changes in the brain caused by lead are significant and persistent. however, these adverse impacts are subtle and although clearly identified at the population level, not predictive for individual children. in addition, the recommended interventions have not been shown to reduce blood lead levels once they are elevated. finally, clinical laboratory and office-based blood lead testing devices are not required to quantify blood lead levels < 4 μg/dl and in many cases cannot reliably test for low blood lead levels. revising the reference value also will undoubtedly result in diversion of resources away from those population-based interventions which have demonstrated success. we argue for second approach, in the management of lead poisoning in the us from one of evaluation and management at the individual level to one of population based primary prevention. this would require a strategy directed at controlling or eliminating lead in children’s environment before they are exposed. the reference value, as a benchmark, is essential to ensure that primary prevention efforts are successful.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"global burden of intellectual disability resulting from dietary exposure to lead, 2015","lead is a ubiquitous dietary contaminant that occurs in food because of natural and anthropogenic sources and pathways of exposure. lead adversely affects a number of tissues and organ systems and the severity of effect on each is dependent on the level and duration of exposure. the most sensitive and notable effects are those that occur on the nervous system. this is particularly the case in the exposure to the fetus, infant and child. infants and children generally have higher lead exposures on a body weight basis. while lead exposure can come from many sources, a major source of exposure for at least some individuals comes from food. estimates for the impact of dietary lead on iq were developed from published total diet studies. while most of these were designed to characterize intake of chemical contaminants on a national basis, some sampled market baskets from a single city. to develop global estimates, default ranges were created for countries with no data which encompassed the values encountered elsewhere. blood lead levels and iq decrements were estimated using functions previously developed by the who joint expert committee for food additives. since both the exposure and dose response components were variable and uncertain, a two dimensional monte-carlo simulation was used to develop the estimates for the impact of dietary lead on iq. in addition to estimating blood lead and iq decrements attributable to dietary lead from those countries with published market basket data, simulations were also run for who regions that sampled in the variability dimension based on the population size of the individual countries in each region. dietary exposure to lead occurs throughout the world. the global average iq decrement attributable to dietary lead was 1.1. the total number of disability-adjusted life years (dalys) arising from those iq decrements were estimated to be 5.2 million dalys, with an uncertainty range of 0-31 million dalys. significant uncertainties regarding exposure and dose-response relationships, however, warrant continued investigation.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,
the legacy lead deposition in soils and its impact on cognitive function in preschool-aged children in the united states,"surface soil contamination has been long recognized as an important pathway of human lead exposure, and is now a worldwide health concern. this study estimates the causal effects of exposure to lead in topsoil on cognitive ability among 5-year-old children. we draw on individual level data from the 2000 u.s. census, and usgs data on lead in topsoil covering a broad set of counties across the united states. using an instrumental variable approach relying on the 1944 interstate highway system plan, we find that higher lead in topsoil increases considerably the probability of 5-year-old boys experiencing cognitive difficulties such as learning, remembering, concentrating, or making decisions. living in counties with topsoil lead concentration above the national median roughly doubles the probability of 5-year-old boys having cognitive difficulties. nevertheless, it does not seem to affect 5-year-old girls, consistent with previous studies. importantly, the adverse effects of lead exposure on boys are found even in counties with levels of topsoil lead concentration considered low by the guidelines from the u.s. epa and state agencies. these findings are concerning because they suggest that legacy lead may continue to impair cognition today, both in the united states and in other countries that have considerable lead deposition in topsoil.

comparative optimism: relative risk perception and behavioral response to lead exposure,"despite their true exposure, individuals with comparative optimism consider themselves less prone to the adverse health effects of pollution. since individuals' response to a given environmental risk is affected by their appraisal of the risk, those with comparative optimism may be less likely to engage in prescribed behaviors or to do so at the urgency required of the given risk. such limited or delayed response can amplify the risk instead of reducing it. thus, there is a need to understand if comparative optimism applies to pollutants with irreversible adverse health effects as it would impose a higher burden. there is also a need to know which segments of the population are prone to comparative optimism and how it manifests in terms of activities that can enhance exposure. doing so will allow public health professionals address gaps in risk communication and management efforts and help improve environmental health outcomes. using survey data, we assess the presence, behavioral and socioeconomic predictors, and implications of comparative optimism for communicating and managing lead exposure risk in an urban setting. our results indicate that a large share of the population has comparative optimism for lead exposure, despite living in a city that has a relatively higher lead poisoning burden. we also found that ethnicity, income, length of stay at residence, among others, predict comparative optimism, suggesting that comparative optimism may predict elevated blood lead level. highlightsdespite their city's high lead poisoning burden, many underrate their relative risk.underrating relative risk associates with exposure-enhancing activities.profiling such individuals could help in targeted risk communication and management.risk communication efforts should include exposure levels of a reference group.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,,,,

"true exposure to lead at the tap: insights from proportional sampling, regulated sampling and water use monitoring","this work aimed to evaluate the ability of four regulatory sampling protocols to accurately determine weekly water lead levels (wlls) of exposure at the kitchen tap in twenty-nine households with or without a lead service line (lsl). proportional sampling was used as the gold standard to which the other protocols, 5-min flush, 30-min stagnation, 6-h stagnation and random daytime were compared. random daytime samples provided mean wlls closest to true exposure in the households monitored overall compared to other sampling protocols. strikingly, mean wlls after 5 min of flushing underestimated lead exposure by 47%. supporting these observations, water usage patterns revealed that full flushing only occurs in 3.4% of usage events within the service line and in 0.26% at the tap. the time between usage events in the service line was approximately 30 min but the 30-min protocol tended to slightly underestimate wlls. these differences were explained by flushing prior to the 30-min stagnation sampling, which limited the contribution of the lsl to wlls. furthermore, the average stagnation at the kitchen time was 106 min and usage events rarely exceeded the water volume within premise plumbing (1.1 l). mean wlls after 6 h of stagnation without flushing overestimated exposure by 29% but provided a conservative indicator of wlls of exposure.

the concurrent decline of soil lead and children's blood lead in new orleans,"lead (pb) is extremely toxic and a major cause of chronic diseases worldwide. pb is associated with health disparities, particularly within low-income populations. in biological systems, pb mimics calcium and, among other effects, interrupts cell signaling. furthermore, pb exposure results in epigenetic changes that affect multi-generational gene expression. exposure to pb has decreased through primary prevention, including removal of pb solder from canned food, regulating lead-based paint, and especially eliminating pb additives in gasoline. while researchers observe a continuous decline in children's blood lead (bpb), reservoirs of exposure persist in topsoil, which stores the legacy dust from leaded gasoline and other sources. our surveys of metropolitan new orleans reveal that median topsoil pb in communities (n = 274) decreased 44% from 99 mg/kg to 54 mg/kg (p value of 2.09 x 10(-08)), with a median depletion rate of similar to 2.4 mg.kg.y(-1) over 15 y. from 2000 through 2005 to 2011 through 2016, children's bpb declined from 3.6 mu g/dl to 1.2 mu g/dl or 64%(p value of 2.02 x 10(-85)), a decrease of similar to 0.2 mu g.dl.y(-1) during a median of 12 y. here, we explore the decline of children's bpb by examining a metabolism of cities framework of inputs, transformations, storages, and outputs. our findings indicate that decreasing pb in topsoil is an important factor in the continuous decline of children's bpb. similar reductions are expected in other major us cities. the most contaminated urban communities, usually inhabited by vulnerable populations, require further reductions of topsoil pb to fulfill primary prevention for the nation's children.",nongeographical,louisiana,0,New Orleans,environment,environment,outdoor

risky bismuth: distinguishing between lead contamination sources in soils,"in a broad environmental study in st. joseph county, indiana, elemental data from 2000 soil samples and 800 paint samples were collected with x-ray fluorescence (xrf) spectroscopy. the observed lead concentrations were compared to other elemental concentrations in these data. a strong correlation between lead and bismuth concentrations was observed in a subset of the soil samples and in nearly all of the paint samples, with lead levels approximately 150 times higher than bismuth. however, some soil samples contained lead with no bismuth present. since most lead sources likely contain bismuth as an impurity from refining of native lead ore, but leaded gasoline does not contain any bismuth impurities due to the manufacturing process of tetraethyl lead, it may be possible to distinguish environmental lead sources by xrf. to test if leaded gasoline could be the source of lead in the subset of soil samples containing no bismuth, leaded paint samples were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy (icp-oes), which confirmed the presence of bismuth in leaded paint. aviation gasoline, which contains tetraethyl lead, was also analyzed by icp-oes to confirm the absence of bismuth in leaded gasoline. this discovery suggests that xrf can be used to rapidly distinguish different legacy lead contamination sources from one another. for low lead concentrations, elemental measurements of bismuth by icp-oes can be used in environmental forensics to distinguish leaded gasoline contamination from other sources of lead.

"blood lead levels in children in urban and rural areas: using multilevel modeling to investigate impacts of gender, race, poverty, and the environment","many studies of children's exposure to lead (pb) are carried out in urban and industrialized environments. this study analyzed blood lead level (bll) data collected from 2011 to 2016 from approximately 140,000 children ages <1 to 6 years across south carolina (sc), including urban and rural areas. individual-level characteristics included children's age, and race/ethnicity. block group variables examined included population by race and ethnicity, households below the poverty level, median year homes built, urban/rural classification, and percent road coverage. bll were higher in urban compared to rural children but increased to a greater extent in rural children from age < 1 year to 2 years. road coverage was strongly associated with higher bll in urban areas, and with home age more weakly, but neither road coverage nor home age was associated with bll in rural areas. young urban children may receive greater exposure to pb from house dust and outdoor legacy pb contamination, and young rural children through diet and drinking water. black children had higher bll in urban areas than white children, and the converse was true in rural areas. population data indicated that rural areas had more poverty than urban areas, but strong associations between increased children's bll and either ethnicity or socio-economic status (ses) at the block group level was not observed, likely due to distinct characteristics of poverty and geographic distribution by ethnicity in urban as compared to rural areas of sc. individual demographics and environmental characteristics may be more closely associated with bll than geographically aggregated ses and race/ethnicity characteristics. interventions to reduce children's exposure to pb should occur at as early an age as possible, and differences between rural and urban areas should be considered as interventions are developed to reduce children's bll.",nongeographical,south carolina,0,South Carolina,sociodemographic,sociodemographic,NA
blood metal levels and early childhood anthropometric measures in a cohort of canadian children,"fetal exposure to some toxic metals has been associated with reduced fetal growth, but the impact of contemporary, low-level metals on anthropometric measures in childhood is not well understood. our primary objective was to quantify associations between childhood levels of toxic metals and concurrently measured body mass index (bmi) in a population of canadian preschool-aged children. we collected biomonitoring data and anthropometric measures on 480 children between the ages of two and five years in the maternal-infant research on environmental chemicals (mirec) child development plus study. concentrations of four toxic metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury) were measured in whole blood collected from pregnant women and their children. blood levels of key essential elements were also measured in children. children's weight, height, and bmi z-scores were calculated using the world health organization growth standards. we used a series of linear regression models, adjusted for potential parental confounders, concurrently measured metals and elements, and prenatal blood metal levels, to evaluate associations between tertiles of each toxic metal and anthropometric measures. we tested for effect modification by sex. of the 480 children, 449 (94%) were singleton births and had complete biomonitoring and anthropometric data. the majority of children had detectable concentrations of metals. in the adjusted models, girls with blood lead concentrations in the highest tertile (> 0.82 mu g/dl) had, on average, 0.26 (95% ci: -0.55, 0.03) lower bmi z-scores than those in the referent category. in contrast, boys with lead levels in the highest tertile had, on average, 0.14 higher bmi z-scores (95% ci: -0.14, 0.41) (p-value heterogeneity = 0.04). in this population of canadian preschool-aged children with low-level blood lead concentrations, we observed effect modification by sex in the association between pb and bmi but no statistically significant associations in the sex-specific strata. child blood levels of as, cd, and hg were not associated with childhood bmi, weight, or height in boys or girls.",nongeographical,nongeographical,1,Canada,,,
contributions of artifactual materials to the toxicity of anthropogenic soils and street dusts in a highly urbanized terrain,"a study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the presence of fly ash and other artifactual materials (ams) significantly increases the toxicity of urban soil and street dust. ams were distinguished as artifacts (artificial particles > 2 mm in size), and particulate artifacts (<2 mm in size); street dust was the <63 mu m fraction of street sediments. reference artifacts, street dusts, and topsoils representing different land use types in detroit, michigan were analyzed for miscellaneous radionuclides, trace elements, magnetic susceptibility (ms), and acetic acid-extractable (leachable) pb. background levels were established using native glacial sediments. street sediments were found to have a roadside provenance, hence street dusts inherited their contamination primarily from local soils. all soils and dusts had radionuclide concentrations similar to background levels, and radiological hazard indices within the safe range. artifacts, fly ash-impacted soils and street dusts contained elevated concentrations of toxic trace elements, which varied with land use type, but none produced a significant amount of leachable pb. it is inferred that toxic elements in ams are not bioavailable because they are occluded within highly insoluble materials. hence, these results do not support our hypothesis. rather, ams contribute to artificially-elevated total concentrations leading to an overestimation of toxicity. ms increased with increasing total concentration, hence proximal sensing can be used to map contamination level, but the weak correlation between total and leachable pb suggests that such maps do not necessarily indicate the associated biohazard. home site soils with total pb concentrations >500 mg kg(-1) were sporadically toxic. thus, these results argue against street dust as the local cause of seasonally elevated blood-pb levels in children. lead-bearing home site soil tracked directly indoors to form house dust is an alternative exposure pathway.
