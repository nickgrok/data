"Human health risk assessment of metals exposure through subsistence foods consumption and subsistence harvest activities near a mining transport road in northwest Alaska","Historical transport of ore concentrate over a 50-mile haul road from the Red Dog zinc/lead mine in northwest Alaska to a seaport has been associated with elevated lead levels on moss growing near the road and with concerns about the safety of subsistence foods. As part of a comprehensive evaluation of potential impacts to human health and the environment from metals released during overland transport of ore concentrate, a human health risk assessment was conducted. Exposure to site-related metals through subsistence food consumption, water ingestion, and incidental soil ingestion was evaluated for three scenarios: child subsistence use, adult subsistence use, and adult combined occupational and subsistence use. The risk assessment used local subsistence food consumption data and subsistence harvest area information, along with metal concentrations from soil, water, caribou, fish, ptarmigan, berries, and sourdock collected on or near the road and port. The results, along with other lines of evidence, indicate that risks associated with subsistence food consumption and harvest activities are well within acceptable limits for each scenario and that subsistence foods remain safe to eat. Additionally, human health risks are not elevated even when data from restricted areas of the road and port are included.","0","Alaska","None","soil"
"Public health. Childhood lead exposure in Wisconsin in 1990","It will take the cooperation of many people to address the issue of lead poisoning. The recent death has dramatized the problem of high dose exposures. But a larger challenge is posed by the fact that most preschool children in Wisconsin are not screened for lead and as a result many asymptomatic children without signs of pica behavior will experience subtle neurological damage as a result of low to moderate elevations of lead in blood. Because many of these cases occur in children without recognized pica behavior, doctors need to expand screening, especially during well child visits, to identify children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, the public health community and property owners need to evaluate and control sources of lead. Major efforts are needed to address the lead hazards which now impair hundreds of Wisconsin children each year.","1991","Wisconsin","None","social"
"UMBILICAL-CORD BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA","During the fall of 1984, we conducted a survey of umbilical cord blood lead levels of 723 live births that occurred at 5 hospitals located in 5 cities in California. Historical ambient air lead levels were used as a qualitative surrogate of air and dust exposure. The area-specific cord blood means (all means approximately 5-mu-g/dl), medians, deciles, and distributions did not vary among locations. The California distributions included means that were lower than the 6.6-mu-g/dl reported in Needleman et al.'s Boston study in 1979. Indeed, the entire California distribution was shifted to the left of the Boston study distribution, even though 3% of the California cord lead levels exceeded 10-mu-g/dl-the level above which Needleman et al. have documented psychoneurological effects in children during the first few years of life. Fourteen percent of premature babies had cord blood lead levels above 10-mu-g/dl. The association between prematurity (i.e., < 260 d gestation) and elevated (> 5-mu-g/dl) cord blood lead was observed in all hospitals and yielded a relative risk of 2.9 (95% Cl: .9, 9.2) and a population attributable risk of 47%. Further research is needed to confirm this association and to explore the roles of endogenous and exogenous sources of lead exposure to the mothers who give birth to premature infants.","1991","California","None","None"
"RESIDENTIAL DELEADING - EFFECTS ON THE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OF LEAD-POISONED CHILDREN","Acute elevations of venous blood lead levels (PbB) are periodically reported in children with chronic lead poisoning, during deleading of their houses. To evaluate this phenomenon 114 preschool children who entered the Massachusetts Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program case management system during 1984 and 1985 were retrospectively studied. PbB increased from a mean (+/- SE) of 1.76 +/- 0.03-mu-mol/L (36.4 +/- 0.6-mu-g/dL) prior to deleading to 2.03 +/- 0.07-mu-mol/L (42.1 +/-1.5-mu-g/dL) during deleading (P < .001). Among 41 subjects for whom deleading was done by dry scraping and sanding, the mean mid-deleading PbB was higher than the pre-deleading PbB by 0.44 +/- 0.12-mu-mol/L (9.1 +/- 2.4-mu-/dL). However, when deleading was done by covering or replacement of painted surfaces in the residences of 12 subjects, mid-deleading PbB decreased 0.11 +/- 0.12-mu-g/dL) (2.25 +/- 2.4-mu-g/dL) (P < .005). In a subset of 59 subjects who had no chelation therapy and were available for follow-up 250 +/- 14 days after completion of deleading, PbB had decreased from 1.72 +/- 0.04-mu-mol/L (35.7 +/- 0.9-mu-g/dL to 1.24 +/- 0.04-mu-mol/L (25.5 +/- 0.9-mu-g/dL) (P < .001). The long-term effect of deleading is a significant reduction in PbB. However, deleading resulted in a significant, albeit transient, increase in PbB.","1991","Massachusetts","None","None"
"LEAD-INTOXICATION IN INFANCY","Four years of experience in the evaluation and management of lead intoxication in the first year of life were reviewed. This study was conducted in a lead referral program within the state of Massachusetts, whose comprehensive lead laws include extensive (and now mandatory) lead screening of all children. Over the period of study, 50 (14%) of 370 new patients enrolled in the program were infants aged 12 months or younger. Median age of these infants was 11 months (range 1 through 12 months). Mean peak lead level was 39.0-mu-g/dL while the mean peak erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration was 111.9-mu-g/dL of whole blood. Thirty-two percent of infants were ambulatory at the time lead intoxication was diagnosed, only 24% had a history of pica. Twenty-six percent of parents were welfare dependent. Apparent sources of plumbism included household renovation (n = 20), direct ingestion of paint chips (n = 10), formula preparation with lead-contaminated water (n = 9), lead dust importation (n = 1), and congenital exposure to elevated maternal lead level (n = 1). In 9 cases the source was not found. When this profile was compared with that of a randomly selected group of 47 children aged 18 through 30 months, who were seen in the lead program during the same interval, apparent sources of intoxication in the older group were paint chip ingestion (n = 41), household renovation (n = 2), and unknown (n = 4) (P < .0001). On the basis of these data, it is concluded that lead intoxication in infants is common and has significantly different origins from that in toddlers. Lead intoxication from infant formula reconstituted with contaminated water may account for many of these cases. These findings support recommendations that lead screening begin at the age of 6 months for children with any likelihood of lead exposure.","1992","Massachusetts","None","water"
"Blood lead levels among children in high-risk areas--California, 1987-1990","In the United States, elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) are a major health risk for children; this risk is totally preventable (1). To better characterize lead poisoning among children at high risk for lead exposure in California, the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) conducted lead-screening surveys that measured lead levels in children's blood, household paint, and soil in three selected high-risk areas in northern, southern, and central California. This report summarizes the survey findings and describes CDHS's efforts to reduce lead exposure among children in California, especially among those in high-risk areas.","1992","California","None","soil"
"Reassessment of lead exposure in New Jersey using GIS technology","In order to prevent children's exposure to lead, a variety of sources must be controlled. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy (NJDEPE) is using its Geographic Information System to identify areas within Newark, East Orange, and Irvington, New Jersey, where there may be greater environmental exposure to lead. Sensitive populations are identified through the U.S. Bureau of the Census information. Blood screening data provided by the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) provide reported patterns of elevated blood lead in the study area. Comparisons of these spatial patterns will assist the NJDEPE in its soil sampling activities and lead exposure research, will provide information for public education, and will provide valuable information on sections of the study area where further screening and public education may be needed.","1992","New Jersey","None","soil"
"Assessment of blood lead levels in children living in a historic mining and smelting community","Lead poisoning in childhood is an important public health problem, and thus, it is important to determine how children are exposed to lead. In 1987, the authors conducted an exposure assessment and blood lead screening for children aged 6-71 months living in Leadville, Colorado. High levels of lead had been found in the soil as a result of both past mining and smelting activities and natural mineralization. Blood was collected from each child for lead analysis, and behavioral characteristics were identified through an interview with a parent or guardian. Three sources of exposure to lead were associated with blood lead levels: lead in a core sample taken from the backyard of the family's home, lead brought home on the clothes of a miner, and lead from soldering in the home. Two pathways of exposure were associated with blood lead levels: the child swallowing things other than food, and taking food or a bottle outside to play. Multivariate regression using these variables found effect modification by age. For children aged 6-36 months, only sources of exposure were independent predictors of blood lead levels, while in children aged 37-71 months, a pathway of exposure in addition to sources of exposure independently predicted blood lead levels.","1993","Colorado","None","soil"
"Lead poisoning among low-income children in Orange County, California. A need for regionally differentiated policy","OBJECTIVETo estimate the prevalence of elevated lead levels among children in Orange County, California, and to evaluate the appropriateness of a universal pediatric blood lead screening policy in this community.DESIGNVenous blood lead testing was conducted and results were analyzed according to seven blood lead strata ranging from less than 0.50 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL) to 3.35 mumol/L (70 micrograms/dL) or higher. A cost analysis of the lead-testing program in Orange County was conducted.SETTINGChildren meeting poverty eligibility criteria and attending the Child Health and Disability Prevention Program, the state's implementation of the federal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) services program.PARTICIPANTSA total of 5115 Orange County children between 12 and 72 months of age using EPSDT services from March through December 1992.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESBlood lead levels and associated costs of the testing program stratified by level of blood lead elevation.RESULTSBlood lead levels of 0.50 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL) or higher were found in 371 children (7.25%; 95% confidence interval, 6.66% to 7.85%), but only six children (0.12%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04% to 0.20%) had elevations greater than 1.20 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dL). Five children (83.3%) had histories of lead consumption unrelated to ingestion of lead-containing paint but related to the use of lead-containing folk remedies and cooking utensils. Costs for detection of children with blood levels elevated to 0.50 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL) or higher was $310 per child and for levels of 1.20 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dL) or higher was $19,139 per child.CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that lead poisoning is not a major public health problem among Orange County children and detection of infrequent cases would involve a high cost per child. In jurisdictions with newer housing, initial screening for a history of possible lead exposure alone may offer reasonable efficacy that is cost-effective. The scope of lead-testing programs should be determined according to local needs and conditions.","1993","California","None","social"
"Blood lead levels among children in Hawaii","The objectives of this study were to estimate blood lead levels of children under 6 years of age in the State of Hawaii, to identify high-risk populations, and to decide what kind of blood lead screening program is needed in Hawaii. Children from Oahu and Maui were recruited in medical care facilities and 6 preschools. Informed consent for a blood lead test was obtained from the parents. A questionnaire was administered whenever possible; participation/response rates were quite low, varying between 15% and 50%. The mean blood lead level for the 389 study participants was 4.5 micrograms/dL. Twelve children (3% of children tested) had a level above 9 micrograms/dL. No child was found to have a level above 14 micrograms/dL. Blood lead levels varied by age, geographic area, occupational factors, laboratory that performed the analysis, and type of phlebotomy (capillary versus venous) but not by sex, ethnicity or age of home. Follow-up investigations in the 12 homes of the children with levels above 9/lg/dL were performed and in 3 homes a possible source of lead exposure was found.","1993","Hawaii","None","None"
"CHILDHOOD LEAD-POISONING NEAR ABANDONED LEAD MINING AND SMELTING AREAS - A CASE-STUDY OF 2 AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS","In October, 1990 the Missouri Department of Health entered a contract with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to conduct an exposure study at the Jasper County, Missouri Superfund Site. The primary concern was exposure to elevated levels of lead and cadmium resulting from previous mining of lead and zinc in the area. Several individuals were found to have elevated lead levels and this article is a case study of two households where children with elevated levels resided Due to the lowering of the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) standard for a level of concern in childhood lead poisoning from 25 mug/dl to 10 mug/dl, many environmental health personnel may be requested to evaluate exposure routes and give advice regarding risk reduction to families who reside in areas not previously thought to be problematic. Accomplishing this risk reduction may require passage of local ordinances requiring lead abatement, additional training of field personnel, and cooperative work with other public and governmental entities.","1993","Missouri","None","None"
"HOME CONDITION AND LEAD LEVELS - A CASE-STUDY FROM THE HOMES OF PRESCHOOLERS IN MT PLEASANT, MICHIGAN","This study assessed the relationship between soil and dust lead (Pb) levels and building material, exterior and interior (including window sill) condition, pet ownership, and the presence of a fireplace. Four dust samples and one soil sample were collected from the homes of 42 preschoolers in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. The results of atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that median Pb levels for both soil and dust were two to ten times higher for homes with wood exteriors. Significant variation in soil and dust Pb levels also occurred as a function of home wall condition. Poorly maintained homes had the highest Pb levels. No consistent significant relationship was observed between home Pb levels and a) the presence of pets and b) the presence of a fireplace. On the whole, households participating in the study had low Pb levels. This finding can be attributed to excellent home upkeep by the part of study participants.","1994","Michigan","None","soil"
"Is there lead in the suburbs? Risk assessment in Chicago suburban pediatric practices. Pediatric Practice Research Group","OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine: (1) the prevalence of elevated blood lead (BPb) levels (BPb > or = 10 micrograms/dL) in Chicago suburban children attending Pediatric Practice Research Group practices at 12 and 24 months of age, and (2) the efficacy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Illinois lead exposure risk assessment questions. METHODS: Parents bringing their 1- and 2-year-old children for health supervision visits at pediatric practices completed questionnaires. BPb levels were drawn on children. Both questionnaire and an analyzable BPb level were obtained on 1393 subjects (79.2%). RESULTS: Only 2.1% of our sample had a venous BPb level > or = 10 micrograms/dL (0.48 mumol/L); no subjects had a level > or = 30 micrograms/dL (1.45 mumol/L). The CDC risk assessment questions had a sensitivity of .69 and specificity of .70. Due to the low prevalence of elevated BPb levels in this sample, CDC and Illinois screening strategies had high negative predictive values (.99) and low positive predictive values (.05 and .04, respectively). However, some of the subjects with BPb levels > or = 10 micrograms/dL were not at high risk by CDC and Illinois screening questions; 9 of 29 subjects with elevated lead levels (31%) did not respond affirmatively to any CDC risk assessment questions. The question best predicting an elevated BPb was the determination that the house the child lives in was built before 1960 (sensitivity = .83, specificity = .67). This question is not currently included in CDC or Illinois screening strategies. Screening based on the single question ""Was your house built before 1960?"" would have missed only five (17%) of the children with BPb levels > or = 10 micrograms/dL. Three of these five children were among the 17.1% of 1-year-olds and 26.3% of 2-year-olds in our sample who had moved. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, children living in houses built before 1960 should be considered at high risk for high-dose lead exposure. Due to the high mobility of our sample, phrasing the question to include lifetime exposure (ie, Has your child ever lived in a house built before 1960?) should also be considered. Selective BPb testing of high-risk children in low-prevalence suburban areas using this question would miss few children with elevated BPb. Useful risk assessment questions in other areas and other populations may differ.","1994","Illinois","None","None"
"LEAD-POISONING AMONG BATTERY RECLAMATION WORKERS IN ALABAMA","Lead exposures were evaluated at a battery reclamation facility in Alabama. A questionnaire obtained work and health information. Medical tests included blood lead, zinc protoporphyrin, hematocrit, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and uric acid. An investigation of workers' family members and neighborhood residents was conducted. Fourteen of 15 workers had blood lead levels greater than 50 mug/dL. Zinc protoporphyrin was >79 mug/dL in 14 workers. Four workers had hematocrit <40%; six had elevated serum creatinine (>1.3 mg/dL). Workers' blood lead levels increased significantly over 2 years (beta = 1.004 mug/dL per month). Ten workers had elevated air lead levels. Twelve of 16 employee children had blood lead levels >10 mug/dL; 3 were greater than 40 mug/dL. Workers' children had significantly higher blood lead levels than did neighborhood comparison children. Reclamation of lead batteries unaccompanied by smelting poses a health hazard to workers and their children.","1994","Alabama","None","social"
"Retrospective study of the impact of lead-based paint hazard remediation on children's blood lead levels in St. Louis, Missouri","A retrospective follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of lead-based paint hazard remediation in reducing children's blood lead levels. The authors reviewed existing St. Louis, Missouri, City Health Department records, identified 185 children younger than age 6 years who had blood lead levels > or = 25 micrograms/dl during 1989 or 1990, and compared changes in blood lead levels among children whose dwellings did and those whose dwellings did not undergo remediation. Among 54 children who had not moved or received chelation therapy and whose blood lead levels were measured 10-14 months after diagnosis, the geometric mean blood lead level decreased 23% among children living in remediated dwellings (n = 37) and 12% among children in nonremediated dwellings (n = 17) (p = 0.07, t test). The estimated size of the remediation effect was similar using multiple regression (-13%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -25 to 1; p = 0.06) and an approach based on generalized estimating equations (-16%, 95% CI -25 to -7; p = 0.002), when adjusted for covariates. The effect of remediation was greater among children whose blood lead levels at diagnosis were > or = 35 micrograms/dl (-22%) than among those whose blood lead levels at diagnosis were between 25 and 34 micrograms/dl (-1%). Among lead-poisoned children in St. Louis, children whose dwellings undergo lead-based paint hazard remediation have a greater decline in geometric mean blood lead level than do children whose dwellings do not, but the effect of remediation may be influenced by the blood lead level at diagnosis.","1994","Missouri","None","None"
"Blood lead levels in children from lower socioeconomic communities in Denver, Colorado","We measured blood lead levels and inquired about environmental exposure pathways in 443 children aged 6 mo to 6 y in four lower socioeconomic Denver, Colorado, neighborhoods. Two neighborhoods were adjacent to a cadmium refinery. Eight percent of the children had blood lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl and 45% were below the detection limit of 4 micrograms/dl. Statistical analyses specific to the problem of below-detection values (i.e., dichotomization of variables, the probability plot method of estimation, and the bootstrap estimate of the standard error) were conducted to detect neighborhood differences. A child who lived in Globeville, the neighborhood surrounding the refinery, had a slightly higher probability of having a blood lead level > or = 5 micrograms/dl. Yet, the results as a whole documented the striking decline in blood lead levels in urban children after the deleading of gasoline.","1994","Colorado","social","None"
"Rural-urban blood lead differences in North Carolina children","OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of and risk factors for having a blood lead elevation among young children in a predominantly rural state. METHODS: 20,720 North Carolina children at least 6 months and < 6 years of age were screened between November 1, 1992 and April 30, 1993 using either capillary or venous measurements of blood lead. Children were tested through routine screening programs that target low-income families and, hence, were not randomly selected. Eighty-one percent of the children were screened through local public health departments, and 19% were tested at private clinics. RESULTS: The estimated prevalences of having an elevated blood lead level among those tested were: 20.2% (> or = 10 micrograms/dL), 3.2% (> or = 15 micrograms/dL), and 1.1% (> or = 20 micrograms/dL). Black children were at substantially increased risk of having a blood lead > or = 15 micrograms/dL (odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7 to 2.5). Children aged 2 years old had an elevated risk (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.7) compared to 1-year-olds, and males were at slightly increased risk (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.4). Living in a rural county was nearly as strong a risk factor as race (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.6 to 2.4). The effect of rural residence was even greater among certain subgroups of children already at highest risk of having an elevated blood lead. The type of clinic (public vs private) where a child was screened was not associated with blood lead outcome. These same trends were seen for children with blood lead levels > or = 20 micrograms/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Among children screened from rural communities, the prevalence of elevated blood lead is surprisingly high. Though few physicians have embraced universal lead screening, these data support the need for greater awareness of lead exposure in children living outside of inner-cities.","1994","North Carolina","None","None"
"THE LONGER-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF RESIDENTIAL LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT","Residential lead-based paint and settled dust are important sources of lead exposure in U.S. children. Scant information exists on the long-term effectiveness of alternative lead abatement practices. In this extended (1.5-3.5 years) follow-up study of comprehensive abatement, 179 wipe dust samples were collected in 13 occupied dwellings for which pre-and immediately postabatement (clearance) dust lead data were available. Dust lead loadings (mg/m(2)) 1.5 to 3.5 years postabatement were 16, 10, and 4% of preabatement levels for floors, window sills, and window wells, respectively. Furthermore, 78% of readings remained within Maryland's interim clearance standards, indicating that sustained reductions of dust lead hazards were achieved in comprehensively abated dwellings located in older unabated housing areas.

"Poisoned landscapes: the epidemiology of environmental lead exposure in Massachusetts children 1990-1991","This research models the geographic variation in lead poisoning among children living in Massachusetts between 1990 and 1991. Elevated levels of blood lead, which reduce educational performance, arise because children are exposed to unnaturally concentrated sources of lead in the built environment. A Poisson regression model indicates that a large number of children with lead poisoning may be detected in towns with a high proportion of older housing, female headed households, African-Americans, and an industrial heritage. Our results suggest links between the processes of urbanization and industrialization in Massachusetts and today's lead poisoned landscapes.","1994","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Elevated blood lead levels among construction workers in the Massachusetts Occupational Lead Registry","Although the construction industry until recently was exempt from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration General Industry Lead Standard, including its medical monitoring provisions, periodic blood lead tests have been required for residential ""deleaders"" and structural painters in Massachusetts. Sixty-three percent of the 381 registrants in the Massachusetts Occupational Lead Registry with blood lead levels of 1.93 mumol/L or higher are construction workers. This proportion is much higher than that reported by registries of several states selected for comparison. These data highlight the need for better protection from lead exposure and the effectiveness of mandatory medical surveillance in identifying elevated blood lead levels among construction workers.","1994","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Home abatement and blood lead changes in children with class III lead poisoning","We studied the effect of home abatement on blood lead (PbB) levels in children from central Massachusetts who had not undergone chelation therapy and whose homes were abated between 1987 and 1990, when stricter abatement guidelines were enacted. One hundred and thirty-two children with a mean preabatement PbB of 25.9 micrograms/dL (1.25 mumol/L) were studied: their mean postabatement PbB (up to 1 year later) was 21.1 micrograms/dL (1.02 mumol/L) (P < .001). This reduction correlated with preabatement PbB; 32 of 33 (97%) with preabatement PbB > or = 30 micrograms/dL (> or = 1.45 mumol/L) were lower postabatement, and 64 of 79 (81%) with PbB 20 to 29 micrograms/dL (0.97-1.40 mumol/L) were lower. However, in children with preabatement PbB < 20 micrograms/dL (< 0.97 mumol/L), only seven of 20 (35%) were lower postabatement and, in fact, there was a significant rise in PbB from 16.8 to 19.3 micrograms/dL (0.81 to 0.93 mumol/L) (P = 0.05). Continued improvement in home abatement technology is needed if that strategy is to be effective in achieving the lower PbB levels now mandated in the 1991 Centers for Disease Control guidelines. Primary prevention of the initial blood lead level elevation remains the most desirable strategy.","1994","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Relationship between soil lead, dust lead, and blood lead concentrations in pets and their owners: evaluation of soil lead threshold values","This paper reports the results of a study conducted in Granite City, Illinois during the months of August through October 1991. The study involved a subpopulation of 77 households having 106 dogs and cats which was a corollary to a major study conducted in humans by the Illinois Department of Public Health to evaluate lead exposure. A secondary lead smelter had been in operation in this town for almost 80 years and was shut down in 1982. Important soil contamination with lead was reported and this paper presents data regarding levels of soil and dust lead and associated blood lead concentrations in animals and their owners in a total of 77 households. Overall, blood lead concentrations (BLC) were low (0-13 micrograms/dl in the animal owners; 0-28 micrograms/dl in pets). There was no significant relationship between soil or dust lead and BLC in humans; however, the relationship was significant in animals. Odds ratios were computed to determine whether 500 or 1000 ppm lead in environmental samples was associated with increased risk of having a high BLC. We could not find any increased risk in humans, while the risk did increase in animals. It is concluded that animals are more at risk than their owners of having a high BLC when exposed to the same contaminated environment and can be used to monitor the bioavailability of lead.","1994","Illinois","social","soil"
"LEAD LEVELS IN THE HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENT OF CHILDREN IN 3 HIGH-RISK COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA","To assess environmental lead contamination in the household environment of children in high-risk areas of California, three urban locations were surveyed by the California Department of Health Services. Plant, soil, and dust lead levels were measured and a questionnaire was administered. This survey estimates that 3 million homes in California (27%) may have exterior paint lead levels greater than or equal to 5000 ppm, and 1.3 million homes (12%) may have interior paint lead levels greater than or equal to 5000 ppm. The highest concentrations of lead in paint were found on exterior surfaces and, for homes built between 1920 and 1959, on trim. Age of housing was the best predictor of lead in soil and dust; homes built before 1920 were 10 times more likely to have soil lead levels greater than or equal to 500 ppm compared to post-1950 homes. Most of the variability in dust lead levels could not be explained by factors measured in this survey. Sources of lead in the home were more highly correlated with lead dust concentration levels than they were with lead dust loading levels. Households with members reporting a lead job were twice as likely to have high dust lead levels compared to households with no one reporting a lead job. The significant differences in dust lead concentration levels between communities were not reflected in differences in dust lead loading levels. Measuring dust lead loading levels does not appear to be a meaningful sampling method for risk assessment in the context of prioritizing abatement.

"LEAD IN INNER-CITY SOIL AND ITS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO CHILDRENS BLOOD LEAD","This study was designed to assess distribution and sources of lead in inner-city soils in Washington, D.C. Duplicate soil samples were collected randomly from 239 unpaved front yards of homes in Washington, D.C. Soil samples were collected 1 m from the houses. Lead concentration in soil was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Presence of lead detected in soil was correlated and traced to the anticipated source of origin. A significantly high concentration of lead was present in inner-city soils. Areas of the city in which the highest lead concentrations were found (Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) were determined to contain a large number of residents who had attained lower education levels than most residents in the remaining wards. It was concluded that lead concentration in inner-city soil plays a significant role in the incidence of lead poisoning in children in the District of Columbia and that paint is the main source of soil lead. Demographic characteristics of the residents appeared to enhance the distribution of lead poisoning.","1995","Washington","soil","soil"

Three hundred eighty-one (64.7%) children tested had a PbB > or = 10 micrograms/dL (0.48 mumol/L); the mean PbB was 12.23 micrograms/dL (0.587 mumol/L). These data support a recommendation for lead screening in any child with a history of abuse or neglect if environmental risk factors cannot be assessed.","1995","Illinois","None","None"
"Elevated blood lead prevalence in Florida two-year-olds","The prevalence of blood lead values of 10 mcg/dl or higher was estimated in Florida two-year-olds in a population-based random sample survey. Subjects were chosen at random from birth certificates of children born in Florida in mid-1991. Parents were interviewed and children's blood specimens obtained in the summer of 1993. Results are based on 387 subjects. Overall prevalence of elevated blood lead was 3.2% (95% confidence limits 2.2, 4.0), with nine children in the range of 10 to 14 mcg/dl and four of 15 or over. In certain subgroups, prevalence was higher: nonwhite 9.4% (2.9, 15.9); mother not married 8.3% (3.1, 13.5); mother on Medicaid 6.7% (2.5, 10.8); housing built in 1978 or before 7.1% (2.3, 11.8); yard dirt or dirt plus grass 10.8% (4.6, 16.9). In Florida, prevalence is much lower than in the nation as a whole. A screening strategy that concentrates on screening Medicaid-eligible children and those living in homes built before 1978 would appear to be quite efficient and may uncover a prevalence of 7.0% or more.","1995","Florida","None","None"
"CHILDHOOD LEAD-POISONING IN MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITIES - ITS ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS","Objectives. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between communities' sociodemographic and housing characteristics and incidence of lead poisoning. Methods. This was a population-based correlational study of 238 275 Massachusetts children from birth through 4 years of age who were screened for lead poisoning in 1991-1992. A logistic regression model was developed with the community as the unit of analysis, the case identification rate for lead poisoning (newly identified children with venous blood lead greater than or equal to 25 mu g/dL per 1000 children) as the dependent variable, and US census variables as independent variables. Results. A significant independent relationship with the community case identification rate of lead poisoning was found for seven variables: median per capita income, percentage of housing built before 1950, percentage of the population who were Black, percentage of children screened, and a ''poverty index.'' Rates of iron deficiency and percentage of Hispanics were not associated with the case identification rate of lead poisoning. Conclusions. Massachusetts communities' incidence of lead poisoning is correlated with sociodemographic and housing characteristics. In states similar to Massachusetts and without screening data, this model may help target screening programs.","1995","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Leaded eye cosmetics: a cultural cause of elevated lead levels in children","BACKGROUND: Preventing lead exposure is of paramount importance because lead is significantly toxic at subclinical levels, and treating patients with elevated blood lead levels is difficult. Children were evaluated for lead exposure in California through a state-mandated lead screening program that was begun in November 1991. Imported eye cosmetics were identified as a suspected source of lead exposure for Pakistani and Indian children who used these products. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children at a county hospital clinic was undertaken for the period beginning October 1991 and ending February 1994. Lead exposure questionnaires were filled out at clinic visits, and telephone interviews were conducted with parents or guardians of children from ethnic groups who use eye cosmetics. RESULTS: Lead level results were available for 175 children. The average lead level was 4.3 micrograms/dL (0.21 mumol/L) for Pakistani/Indian children not using eye cosmetics and 12.9 micrograms/dL (0.62 mumol/L) (P = .03) for those using the products. Chemical evaluation of some of the eye cosmetics used by these children revealed high lead content. CONCLUSIONS: Use of eye cosmetics imported from Pakistan was found to be strongly correlated with elevated blood lead levels. Although importation of leaded eye cosmetics is prohibited by law, legislation has not been effective in protecting children from this source of lead exposure. Education regarding low-level lead toxicity and avoidance of substances containing lead is needed, particularly for targeted subpopulations.","1995","California","None","None"
"Blood lead levels and remediation of an abandoned smelter site","Elevated soil lead levels were documented in a New Mexico community, with levels up to 24,800 ppm in a smaller slag pile, 20 or more feet from residences. The New Mexico Department of Health offered blood lead screening to residents of three geographic areas before and after an emergency cleanup by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Blood lead levels prior to the cleanup ranged from undetectable (<5 mu g/dl) to 29 mu g/dl; after the cleanup, they ranged from undetectable to 10 mu/dl. Significant reductions in mean blood lead levels after the cleanup were found for all three geographic areas: from 6/67 mu g/dl to 4 mu g/dl (smelter area), from 4.12 mu g/dl to 2.5 mu g/dl (town area), and from 5.5 mu g/dl to 2.5 mu g/dl (northeast area). In both years, the mean blood lead levels for those living in town for those participating in both years of the study. Mean blood lead levels were significantly higher for smelter area participants who had a household member working at a lead battery plant (19.4 mu g/dl) compared to those residents who did not (5.83 mu g/dl).","1995","New Mexico","None","soil"
"Prevalence of lead poisoning among two-year-old children in Vermont","OBJECTIVES: The recent redefinition of childhood lead poisoning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention means that many more children are considered lead poisoned than previously. The primary purpose of this study was to determine how many 2-year-old children had lead levels of 10 micrograms/dL or more in a rural state. METHODS: Random samples of 334 children drawn from the birth certificate file and 350 children from Vermont Medicaid rosters submitted capillary blood specimens that were confirmed by venous tests if lead levels were 10 micrograms/dL or more. RESULTS: Participation rates were 63.9% in the birth certificate group and 66.4% in the Medicaid group. In the birth certificate sample, the percentages of children with confirmed lead levels 10 micrograms/dL or more, 15 micrograms/dL or more, and 20 micrograms/dL or more were 9.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2-12.6), 2.7 (95% CI, 1.2-5.0), and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5-3.4), respectively. In the Medicaid sample, the corresponding percentages were 14.9 (95% CI, 11.4-19.2), 5.1 (95% CI, 3.1-8.0), and 2.0 (95% CI, 0.8-4.1), respectively. The percentage of children in the state's most urban county with lead levels of 10 micrograms/dL or more was significantly less than that in the rest of the state in both samples. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of elevated lead levels in 2-year-old children may be significant in rural states with old housing stock. Medicaid-enrolled children represent a readily identifiable high-risk group.","1995","Vermont","None","None"
"Lead in house dust: Relationships between exposure metrics","This paper examines the quantitative relationships between dust loading, lead loading, and lead concentration in house dust. Bare floor, interior sill, and carpet dust samples were collected in 216 Jersey City, New Jersey, homes using quantitative wipe and vacuum sampling techniques. Comparison of wipe and vacuum sample distributions for these homes indicated that lead loading was more variable than dust loading or lead concentration measured on floors, sills, or carpets. These data also indicated that increased lead loading on carpets relative to sills or floors was due to higher dust loading on carpets. Correlation analysis of wipe samples indicated that dust loading was more strongly correlated with lead loading on floors (r = 0.73) than on sills (r = 0.53), that dust loading was not correlated with lead concentration on either surface, and that lead loading and lead concentration were more strongly correlated in samples collected from sills (r = 0.81) than from floors (r = 0.65). Most importantly, carpets and rugs served as large reservoirs for house dust and consequently were a large potential source of dust exposure in children's common microenvironments.

"A pilot study of take-home lead exposure in New Jersey","Studies in various industries have found an association between worker exposure to lead and elevated blood lead levels in workers' children, but the magnitude of this problem is unknown. In an effort to characterize this problem further, a pilot study was undertaken to obtain blood lead levels of children of lead-exposed workers with elevated blood lead levels who had been reported by laboratories to the New Jersey Department of Health. Fifteen workers' families participated in this study, including 28 children. Thirty-two percent of the children were found to have blood lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl, the level of concern set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for medical monitoring. This finding is in contrast to population-based data collected from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey, where the overall prevalence of blood lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dl was only 4.5%.","1995","New Jersey","None","None"
"Blood lead levels among children in a managed-care organization--California, October 1992-March 1993","Despite substantial progress in reducing exposures to lead among children, as recently as 1991, 9% of children in the United States had blood lead levels (BLLs) of > or = 10 micrograms/dL (1)--levels that can adversely affect intelligence and behavior. In 1991, CDC recommended screening all children for lead exposure except those residing in communities in which large numbers or percentages previously had been screened and determined not to have lead poisoning (2). Subsequently, the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) issued a directive to all California health-care providers participating in the Child Health and Disability Prevention Program to routinely screen children for lead poisoning in accordance with the 1991 CDC guidelines (3). This report presents finding of BLL testing during 1992-1993 from a managed-care organization that provides primary-care services to Medicaid beneficiaries in several locations in California (i.e., Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Sacramento, and Placerville).","1995","California","None","None"

"Development of a population-specific risk assessment to predict elevated blood lead levels in Santa Clara County, California","OBJECTIVES: To determine: (1) the prevalence of a blood lead level (PbB) of 10 micrograms/dL or greater and 20 micrograms/dL or greater among children aged 6 to 72 months attending the Santa Clara County (SCC), California, public clinics, (2) risk factors for elevated PbB in this population, and (3) whether an SCC public clinic population-specific risk-assessment tool and a five-question lead poisoning questionnaire developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are useful for prospectively identifying children at higher risk for elevated PbB. METHODS: We tested for PbB 3630 children aged 6 to 72 months attending SCC public outpatient clinics between August 8, 1991, and September 1, 1992. We then conducted two matched case-control studies. Five local risk-factor questions were combined with the CDC's five-question lead poisoning questionnaire, and from May 1, 1993, to June 30, 1993, we conducted risk assessments on 247 children tested for PbB. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two of 3630 children (6.1%) had a PbB of 10 micrograms/dL or greater. Thirty-nine (1.1%) had a PbB at least 20 micrograms/dL. Seventy-nine percent of the children screened and 91.0% of the children with PbB at least 10 micrograms/dL were Hispanic. Twenty percent of Mexican-born Hispanic children had a PbB of 10 micrograms/dL or greater, versus 7% of U.S.-born Hispanic children. Several factors were associated with elevated PbB among Hispanic children. For identifying children with a PbB of at least 10 micrograms/dL, the sensitivity and predictive value negative for the CDC's ""high risk"" definition were 30% and 93%, respectively, whereas for the SCC population-specific high-risk definition, the sensitivity was 90% and the predictive value negative was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic children attending SCC public clinics have risk factors for elevated PbB that were not included in the CDC's lead poisoning questionnaire. Methods for prioritizing the frequency of lead screening may be improved by combining the CDC's questions with a population-specific risk assessment.","1995","California","None","None"
"Development of a probabilistic blood lead prediction model","A partially probabilistic blood lead prediction model has been developed, based on the US Environmental Protection Agency integrated exposure-uptake-biokinetic blood lead model (IEUBK model). This study translated the IEUBK model into a spreadsheet format. The uptake submodel incorporates uncertainty distributions for exposure and bioavailability parameters. The biokinetic submodel is duplicated with a table incorporating partitioning and decay of lead levels in the body. As a case study, the probabilistic model is applied to a lead exposure scenario involving a former smelter site in Sandy, Utah. The probabilistic model produces less biased estimates of means and standard deviations than the deterministic model. Parameter uncertainty is propagated in the model by the use of Monte Carte simulation. Thus, sensitivity analysis is possible, and driving variables can be determined.","1995","Utah","None","None"
"Identification of children at risk for lead poisoning: an evaluation of routine pediatric blood lead screening in an HMO-insured population","OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in children receiving well-care checkups; and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain key risk factors in detecting children at higher risk for elevated blood lead levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two facilities of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPMCP) health maintenance organization (HMO), northern California region. PATIENTS: Six hundred thirty-six children, aged 12 to 60 months, who were seen at four KPMCP facilities in two subregions for a well-care checkup from September 1991 through August 1992. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were collected from each child and analyzed for lead content. Participating parents completed a questionnaire that included questions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the child's and the parents' lead exposure via home, workplace, and hobbies. RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of the children had blood lead levels under 10 micrograms/dL. Blood lead levels declined with increasing age and were higher for black children compared with whites. Age of residential housing, mother's education, and residence in an old house with peeling paint had low sensitivity and positive predictive value for identifying children with blood lead levels over 10 micrograms/dL. CONCLUSION: Universal routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in children in an employed, HMO-insured population is not warranted on grounds of prevalence. Responses to CDC questions do not effectively identify high-risk children in this population.","1996","California","None","None"
"Relationship between blood lead and dietary iron intake in preschool children - A cross sectional study","The relationship between dietary iron intake and blood lead levels in urban preschool children was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 299 children from 9 months to 5 years old. Mothers of children attending the University of Maryland Pediatric Ambulatory Clinic volunteered for the children and themselves to join the study. The data collected included nutritional status, socioeconomic status, medical history, and potential sources of lead exposure. Blood samples from all participants were evaluated for levels of blood lead, serum iron (ferritin), free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, calcium, and hematocrit. The average blood lead level (standard deviation) in the studied population was 11.4 (7.3) mu g/dL. With multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to adjust for covariates, a negative association (P = 0.03) between blood lead and dietary iron intake was found. This finding is consistent with similar results from experimental studies. It is concluded that there is evidence chat higher dietary iron intake is associated with lower blood lead among urban preschool children in the studied population.","1996","Maryland","None","social"
"Relationship between blood lead and nutritional factors in preschool children: a cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between selected nutritional factors and blood lead levels of preschool children. METHODOLOGY: Data on 296 children, aged 9 to 72 months, who were cared for at the University of Maryland at Baltimore Pediatric Ambulatory Center were examined in this cross-sectional study. Nutritional status, socioeconomic aspects, medical history, and potential sources of lead exposure were assessed. Blood samples were evaluated for levels of blood lead, serum iron (ferritin), free erythrocyte photoporphyrin, calcium, and hematocrit. RESULTS: The average blood lead level was 11.4 micrograms/dL. Multicollinearity of nutritional factors was addressed using regression techniques. After adjusting for confounders, significant positive associations with blood lead were found for total caloric intake (P = .01) and dietary fat (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that even when behavioral and environmental exposures to lead were statistically controlled, total caloric intake and dietary fat each had an independent and significant association with the level of blood lead.","1996","Maryland","social","None"
"Lead poisoning risk determination in a rural setting","Objectives. To determine the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among children living in a rural area and to determine the effectiveness of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Lead Risk Assessment Questionnaire and additional questionnaire items in correctly identifying rural children having elevated blood lead levels. Research Design. Comparison of results of a questionnaire that is intended to identify children as being at low or high risk for lead poisoning with children's blood lead levels. Setting. The three practice sites of the only pediatric group in a rural county of upstate New York. Patients. A consecutive sample of 705 children ages 6 to 72 months who were seen for health supervision visits between June and September 1993. Results. Sixty-nine percent of the children were considered to be at high risk for lead poisoning by the CDC questionnaire. Overall, 8.4% of the children in the study had blood lead levels of 10 micrograms/dL (0.48 micromoles/L) or higher, and 2.1% had blood lead levels of 15 micrograms/dL (0.72 micromoles/L) or higher. No significant difference was noted between the percentages of high- and low-risk children who had elevated blood lead levels. To devise a more effective lead risk assessment tool for children in this setting, the two items from the CDC questionnaire and the two additional items that had the greatest predictive utility were combined to form a short alternative questionnaire. The alternative questionnaire thus consisted of items concerning whether the child has a sibling or playmate with lead poisoning, whether the child lives near an industry that potentially may release lead, whether the child lives in rented or owner-occupied housing, and whether the child has a parent who is a migrant farm worker. Children categorized as high risk with the alternative questionnaire were much more likely to have elevated blood lead levels than those who were categorized as low risk. The alternative questionnaire was very effective in correctly identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Eighty-eight percent of children having blood lead levels of 10 micrograms/dL or higher and 100% of children having blood lead levels of 15 micrograms/dL or higher were classified as high risk by the questionnaire. Children classified as low risk were very unlikely to have elevated blood lead levels; 98% of low-risk children had blood lead levels of less than 10 micrograms/dL, and 100% had blood lead levels of less than 15 micrograms/dL.","1996","New York","None","None"

"Counseling to prevent childhood lead poisoning","Excessive lead exposure continues to be a pervasive and serious threat to the health and well-being of the nation's children. The current guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend education (during well-child visits) regarding the major preventable sources of lead and how to prevent excessive exposure. To determine if parents receive counseling to prevent excessive lead exposure in their children, a survey of parental knowledge on prevention of lead exposure was administered to parents of children recently identified as having elevated blood lead levels, Surveys were administered by lead program outreach workers prior to an educational visit in urban neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. Parents of 139 children (88% ethnic minorities; mean age: 31 months) with recently identified elevated blood lead levels (mean: 1 mu mol/L) participated, Fifty-one percent first learned of their child's elevated lead level at the time they were contacted by an outreach worker, Seventy-one percent did not recall having been counseled regarding lead poisoning or its prevention prior to this contact, Before the outreach visit, 17% had been counseled but after the elevated lead was detected. Only 12% of the parents had received preventive counseling prior to detection of the elevated lead level, We conclude that despite CDC recommendations, adequate counseling for preventing lead poisoning does not occur for a substantial number of children who have elevated lead levels.","1996","Massachusetts","None","None"
"The accuracy of a lead questionnaire in predicting elevated pediatric blood lead levels","OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels and to evaluate the accuracy of a lead screening questionnaire in a western United States urban inner-city pediatric population. DESIGN: A convenience sample of children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years seen for a well-child visit were enrolled. Venous blood lead levels were measured and a lead screening questionnaire was completed. SETTING: The primary care clinics of the 10 community health centers of the city and county of Denver, Colorado. Approximately 85% of children receiving services are below the 150% poverty level and 54% are insured through the state's Medicaid program. SUBJECTS: A total of 2978 children seen for a well-child visit from February 1993 to January 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels and the operating characteristics of both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lead screening questionnaire and the complete questionnaire used in Denver, using venous blood lead levels as the criterion standard. RESULTS: The mean blood lead level was 0.20 mumol/L (4.19 micrograms/dL). Eighty-five children had blood lead levels of 0.48 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL), representing 2.9% of the study group (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.5). Only 0.3% of the cohort had blood lead levels greater than 0.96 mumol/L (20 micrograms/dL). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention questionnaire was 57%, 51%, and 3%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the complete questionnaire was 59.7%, 36%, and 2.6%, respectively. The marginal cost of identifying a child with a blood lead level greater than 0.96 mumol/L (20 micrograms/dL) was $4925. CONCLUSIONS: Few of the low-income children in this study had blood lead levels greater than 0.48 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL). The questionnaire did little better than chance at predicting the presence or absence of elevated blood lead levels and cannot replace a blood lead level test for childhood lead screening in this community.","1996","Colorado","None","None"

"Analysis of lead in soils adjacent to an interstate highway in Tampa, Florida","In order to assess the amount and distribution of lead pollution in soils adjacent to a major interstate highway serving the city of Tampa, Florida, a total of 224 samples were collected from 32 transects perpendicular to the roadway. The lead content was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest levels of lead were found at distances of 81, 243, and 729 cm from the road. The results show that there is a weak negative correlation between soil lead and the distance from the roadside, as well as with traffic density. The weakness of the relationship is a result of confounding variables such as turbulence and other microclimatic factors, downslope movement of soils over time, and human action such as construction and highway landscaping. Nevertheless, over one-third of the samples collected in the study area contain more than 500 mu g g(-1) lead, levels considered to be hazardous by the United States Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.","1996","Florida","soil","soil"
"Blood lead levels in a continuity clinic population","INTRODUCTION: Lead toxicity is well recognized as a significant cause of morbidity in children, especially those under the age of six years. While lead toxicity has not been recognized as a public health problem in Houston, it is possible that children in the area suffer from low-level lead effects on the central nervous system. OBJECTIVES: To detect asymptomatic cases of lead toxicity in one population of Houston children and to assess the effectiveness of the lead risk questionnaire. DESIGN: Venous blood samples for quantitative lead were analyzed utilizing the Anodic Stripping Voltameter. The Centers for Disease Control's lead risk assessment questionnaire was administered to each patient. SETTING: Baylor College of Medicine Continuity Clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. SUBJECTS: All patients, ages 9-72 months, seen for routine care between December 1992 and June 1994 were screened once. RESULTS: Blood lead levels were obtained on 801 children; all but 47 completed lead risk questionnaires. The mean age of the study group was 2.37 years (SD 1.84) and they were 54% male. They were 39% Hispanic, 39% Black, and 18% White. Eighty-eight percent reported an annual income of < $20,000. They lived in 127 separate zip codes. Twenty-five (3.1%) patients had elevated blood lead, 21 between 10-14 micrograms/dL and 4 between 15-19 micrograms/dL. No patients had blood lead levels of > or = 20 micrograms/dL. No statistically significant differences were found between patients with blood lead < 10 micrograms/dL and those with > or = 10 micrograms/dL when comparing for age, sex, ethnicity, income, and zip code. Only those children living in or regularly visiting a pre-1960 home with peeling or chipping paint were significantly more likely to have elevated blood lead (p = .045). CONCLUSION: Although the majority of children in our setting were poor and urban, the prevalence of blood lead > or = 10 micrograms/dL was 3.1%, well below the estimated 17% quoted by the Centers for Disease Control in recommending stringent screening guidelines. The lead risk assessment questionnaire failed to identify 32% of children with elevated blood lead levels. Since this questionnaire is critical to screening populations at low risk for lead toxicity, it is important to determine whether a revised questionnaire or a more careful elicitation of parental responses will improve identification of those children at risk.","1997","Texas","None","None"
"Census tract analysis of lead exposure in Rhode Island children","There has been increasing interest in a targeted approach to the screening and prevention of lead exposure in children. Targeted screening requires an understanding of variation in lead exposure in individual children or by region. In order to better understand variation by region, we studied Rhode Island lead poisoning screening data, examining average lead exposure to children living in 136 Providence County census tracts (CTs). The study population included 17,956 children aged 59 months and under, who were screened between May 1, 1992, and April 30, 1993. We evaluated the relationship between the percentage of children with blood lead greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dL (pe10) and sociodemographic and housing characteristics, derived from United States 1990 Census data, of these CTs. CT descriptors included population density, percentage of households receiving public assistance income, median per capita income, percentage of households female headed, percentage of houses owner occupied, percentage of houses built before 1950, percentage of houses vacant, percentage of population Black, percentage of recent immigrants, and intraurban mobility. On average, 109 children were screened in each census tract; mean screening rate was 44%. There was wide variation in average lead exposure among census tracts, with pe10 ranging from 3 to 60% of screened children (mean 27%). Individual census variables explained between 24 and 67% of the variance in pe10 among CTs. A multiple regression model including percentage screened, percentage of households receiving public assistance, percentage of houses built before 1950. In (percentage of houses vacant), and percentage of recent immigrants explained 83% of variance in pe10. The percentage of houses built before 1950, a variable which models the presence of lead paint in old houses, displayed the largest adjusted effect on pe10 over the range observed for that variable in RI CTs. The percentage of houses vacant was also a highly significant and robust predictor; we suggest that vacancy is an ecological marker for the deterioration of lead-based paint, with higher vacancy neighborhoods containing houses in poorer condition. In Rhode Island, census tracts with high vacancy rates also have high rates of recent immigration, making immigrant groups vulnerable to lead exposure. Small-areas analysis may be useful in directing resources to high risk areas, explaining the sociocultural forces which produce such exposure and analyzing the effects of housing policy over time in states with high screening penetration.

"Children with elevated blood lead levels attributed to home renovation and remodeling activities--New York, 1993-1994","Renovation and remodeling activities that disturb lead-based paint can create substantial amounts of lead dust in the home; such dust can then be inhaled or ingested by children. In January 1995, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) assessed lead exposure among children resulting from home renovation and remodeling during 1993-1994. This report summarizes findings of the study, which identified 320 children in New York state (excluding New York City) with blood lead levels (BLLs) > or = 20 micrograms/dL that were considered to be attributable to residential renovation and remodeling.","1997","New York","None","None"
"Hygiene- and food-related behaviors associated with blood lead levels of young children from lead-contaminated homes","Exposures associated with blood lead levels greater than 40 micrograms/dL in young children who live in lead-contaminated homes have been well documented. As the action level for lead is reduced, activities that contribute to lower levels of lead exposure must be identified. A child's eating habits and related hygiene behaviors are major hand-to-mouth activities that have been largely overlooked in the study of activities contributing to lead ingestion. To examine this subject, a survey questionnaire for caretakers of young children was developed. The objective of the questionnaire was to characterize food-related activities of young children and to identify behavioral indicators of lead exposure. The association between food- and hygiene-related behaviors and blood lead levels among 60 children between 13 and 36 months old with low-to-moderate blood lead levels was examined in homes that had been identified as containing lead in paint and house dust. The participants were enrolled in the Children's Lead Exposure and Reduction Study in Jersey City, New Jersey. Blood lead levels of children 13-24 months old did not differ significantly from those of children 25-36 months of age (10.1 and 11.3 micrograms/dL, respectively). Differences in eating habits and hygiene behaviors were found for the two age groups. Bivariate analyses found that the primary behavioral indicators of blood lead levels were determined by whether the child prepared his/her own food and whether the child ate food that had been on the floor. This factor was dependent on age. Children 13-24 months old had significantly elevated blood lead levels if these behaviors exhibited. No significant differences were found, however, for children 25-36 months old. Several food-related habits were also associated with blood lead levels. Eating hamburgers, doughnuts, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and cold cuts were associated with elevated blood lead levels in 13-24-month-old children, while eating vitamins, raw vegetables, and yogurt were associated with lower blood lead levels in this age group. For children 25-36 months old, eating hamburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches was associated with elevated blood lead levels, while yogurt consumption was associated with lower blood lead levels.","1997","New Jersey","None","None"
"Demographic risk factors associated with elevated lead levels in Texas children covered by Medicaid","This is the first large population-based study of demographic risk factors for elevated lead in Texas children. It summarizes data on 92,900 children covered by Medicaid screened for blood lead during the first 6 months of 1993 in Texas. The highest percentage of elevated lead levels (14.3%) was in children 25-36 months of age, with slightly lower percentages in those younger (13% of 19-24 months) and older (12% of 37-48 months) with blood lead levels greater than 10 micrograms/dl. The group with the highest percentage of elevated blood lead levels was 2-4-year-old African American males (17.3%) making this subgroup 3.5 times higher than the group with the lowest percentage-white girls over age 4 (4.8%). Males had higher blood lead levels for all ages and ethnic groups. Three principal risk factors were found for excessive blood lead in children: ethnicity, gender, and age; this is consistent with the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) and Phase I of the NHANES III results demonstrating ethnicity and income association with lead in children in the United States.","1997","Texas","None","None"
"A case-control study to determine risk factors for elevated blood lead levels in children, Idaho","OBJECTIVE: A pair-matched, case-control study was conducted to identify if risk factors or behaviors suspected to affect childhood blood lead levels, were more prevalent among children with elevated blood lead levels living in the vicinity of a defunct mining and smelting facility. METHODS: Study individuals were recruited from the 1992 Silver Valley blood lead screening participants. The cases were children with a blood lead level > 10 micrograms per deciliter (microgram/dL). The controls were children with a blood lead level < 10 micrograms/dL, who were matched to cases by age and sex. Data on risk factors were obtained through personal interviews. RESULTS: Of the variables examined, yard soil remediation showed the strongest association with changes in blood lead levels. This variable was found to be a protective factor for elevated blood lead levels in children (odds ratio, 0.28; confidence interval, 0.08-0.92). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that removal of lead contaminated soil from residential yards was effective in reducing blood lead levels in children.","1997","Idaho","None","soil"
"Prenatal care and infant lead exposure","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the relation between prenatal care of mothers and blood lead concentrations in their offspring in the first year of life. METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted of 200 predominantly black infants between the ages of 6 and 22 months (mean age, 13.4 months). The infants had been screened for the first time since birth at the Charleston County (South Carolina) Health Department. They resided in a neighborhood with the highest prevalence of lead poisoning in Charleston. Prenatal care use data were obtained after matching birth records with lead-screening records. RESULTS: Seventy-three infants (37%) had blood lead levels 0.48 micromol/L (> or = 10 microg/dl) or higher. Adequacy of prenatal care, defined by the Modified Kessner Index, showed 11% with intensive care (26% of these with high lead levels), 39% with adequate care (35% high blood lead levels), 35% with intermediate care (40% with high blood lead levels), 13% with inadequate care (42% with high blood lead levels), and 2% with no prenatal care (25% with high blood lead levels). With the exception of the small group with no prenatal care (n = 4), the proportion of infants with a high blood lead level was inversely proportional to the level of care. The logistic regression model that best fit the data included age at screen for lead and birth weight. Low birth weight babies (<2500 gm) were more likely to have a high blood lead level at primary screen than babies who were heavier at birth (odds ratio, 2.60; p = 0.04), and the older the baby at screening, the greater the likelihood of a high blood lead level (odds ratio, 1.23; p = 0.01). There was a trend for black infants to have a high blood lead level more often than white infants (odds ratio, 3.05; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Less than adequate use of prenatal care may reflect an increase in risk factors contributing to lead exposure in infancy. Low birth weight also was related to high blood lead levels. Further studies are required to differentiate among several hypotheses for this effect. Intrauterine lead exposure, which is known to reduce birth weight, may contribute to measured blood lead levels at first screen. Alternatively, low birth weight may increase lead absorption and retention in infancy or may increase risk of lead exposure.","1997","South Carolina","None","None"

"Targeted screening for childhood lead exposure in a low prevalence area--Salt Lake County, Utah, 1995-1996","During 1991-1994, an estimated 930,000 U.S. children aged < 6 years had blood lead levels (BLLs) > or = 10 micrograms/dL, and the risk for an elevated BLL was greatest among children who were non-Hispanic black or Mexican American, from low-income families, living in large metropolitan areas, or living in housing built before 1946. Because risk for lead exposure is associated with several different factors, it can vary greatly across relatively small areas. To establish the local prevalence and distribution of childhood lead exposure and develop local blood lead screening recommendations, the Salt Lake City-County Health Department (SLCCHD) offered free blood lead screening to all children aged 12-36 months enrolled at the seven Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah (1995 population: 812,000), during January-October 1995. This report presents findings of the screenings at WIC clinics, describes the design and promotion of local targeted screening recommendations, and describes the resulting increases in appropriate BLL screenings among children.","1997","Utah","None","None"
"Pesticide exposures to children from California's Central Valley: Results of a pilot study","In response to concerns about pesticide use and evidence that contaminants may accumulate in house dust, the California Department of Health Services (DHS) conducted a pilot study of pesticide contamination in rural children's home environments. House dust samples for pesticide analysis were collected from eleven homes, five of which had at least one farmworker (FW) resident. Handwipe samples were collected from one child at each residence (ages 1-3 years). Ten of 33 pesticides tested in house dust were detected. Excluding non-detects, concentrations for diazinon ranged from 0.7-169 ppm in four FW homes and 0.2-2.5 ppm in three non-farmworker (NFW) homes (overall median = 1 ppm), suggesting a difference between FW and NFW homes. Chlorpyrifos ranged from 0.2-33 ppm in three FW homes and < 1 ppm in two NFW homes (overall median < 0.5 ppm). All other pesticides were detected at < 2 ppm at four or fewer homes. The sources of these compounds could not be determined. Co-located samples were considerably different in concentration and lending, indicating intra-household variation. Of nine compounds tested, diazinon and chlorpyrifos were found on the hands of two or three FW children (20-220 ng/hand). Dust ingestion scenarios show child exposures could exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Program diazinon chronic reference dose (9 x 10(5) mg/kg/day). The results suggested that pesticide residues are present in the home environment of some California children and are likely to contribute to exposures. Additional research is feasible and needed to assess the magnitude and distribution of these risks.","1997","California","None","None"
"Statewide assessment of lead poisoning and exposure risk among children receiving Medicaid services in Alaska","OBJECTIVE: Lead poisoning is a well-recognized public health concern for children living in the United States. In 1992, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) regulations required lead poisoning risk assessment and blood lead testing for all Medicaid-enrolled children ages 6 months to 6 years. This study estimated the prevalence of blood lead levels (BLLs) >/=10 microg/dL (>/=0.48 micromol/L) and the performance of risk assessment questions among children receiving Medicaid services in Alaska. DESIGN: Measurement of venous BLLs in a statewide sample of children and risk assessment using a questionnaire modified from HCFA sample questions. SETTING: Eight urban areas and 25 rural villages throughout Alaska. PATIENTS: Nine hundred sixty-seven children enrolled in Medicaid, representing a 6% sample of 6-month- to 6-year-old Alaska children enrolled in Medicaid. OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Determination of BLL and responses to verbal-risk assessment questions. RESULTS: BLLs ranged from <1 microg/dL (<0.048 micromol/L) to 21 microg/dL (1.01 micromol/L) (median, 2.0 microg/dL or 0.096 micromol/L). The geometric mean BLLs for rural and urban children were 2.2 microg/dL (0.106 micromol/L) and 1.5 microg/dL (0.072 micromol/L), respectively. Six (0.6%) children had a BLL >/=10 microg/dL; only one child had a BLL >/=10 microg/dL (11 microg/dL or 0.53 micromol/L) on retesting. Children whose parents responded positively to at least one risk factor question were more likely to have a BLL >/=10 microg/dL (prevalence ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 26.6); the predictive value of a positive response was <1%. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the prevalence of lead exposure was very low (0.6%); only one child tested (0.1%) maintained a BLL >/=10 microg/dL on confirmatory testing; no children were identified who needed individual medical or environmental management for lead exposure. Universal lead screening for Medicaid-enrolled children is not an effective use of public health resources in Alaska. Our findings identify an example of the importance in considering local and regional differences when formulating screening recommendations and regulations, and continually reevaluating the usefulness of federal regulations.","1997","Alaska","None","None"
"Lead poisoning and associated risk factors among preschoolers enrolled in a Head Start program","Despite the fact that lead poisoning is one of the most common pediatric health problems in the United States today, little is known about the prevalence and correlates of this disease among nonurban preschool children living in the southern United States. The purpose of this study was to measure the prevalence of abnormal lead levels and to explore the relationships between lead levels and gender, weight, hemoglobin, and ethnicity. Using a chart review protocol, data were collected from 81 charts of children enrolled in a Head Start program in Florida. The prevalence rate of elevated lead levels was 18.5%, a rate higher than that found in most previous research. No relationship was found between lead levels and gender, weight, hemoglobin, and ethnicity. The results highlight the importance of local screening efforts. Controversies in screening are discussed in this article in some detail with the aim of assisting health care providers make decisions about whether universal screening for lead levels in children is appropriate and whether use of the Centers for Disease Control questionnaire has sufficient value. Further study is needed regarding prevalence rates in different geographic areas in the United States, and factors associated with elevated lead levels.","1997","Florida","None","None"
"Human lead absorption -- Texas","In December 1971, the City-County Health Department in El Paso, Texas, discovered that an ore smelter in El Paso was discharging large quantities of lead and other metallic wastes into the air. Between 1969 and 1971, this smelter had released 1,116 tons of lead, 560 tons of zinc, 12 tons of cadmium, and 1.2 tons of arsenic into the atmosphere through its stacks.","1997","Texas","social","air"
"Quantitative modeling of lead exposure from glazed ceramic pottery in childhood lead poisoning cases","The US EPA's Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) Model is a physiologically-based, multi-compartment model which simulates lead uptake, distribution within the body, and elimination in order to predict children's blood lead levels. This study used the IEUBK to quantify the relative importance of dietary lead exposure from ceramic bean pots (as opposed to other environmental sources including soil, water, air and indoor dust) in children from San Diego County, CA, the majority of whom had been identified (by actual measurements) to have elevated blood lead levels. The EUBK modeling suggested that dietary lead exposure from beans prepared in Mexican pottery may account for a major fraction of the blood lead burden in children (all of Hispanic ethnicity) whose families used such ceramic ware. The IEUBK model tended to be overpredictive of actual values for blood lead levels, but this was most probably due to uncertainties in the exposure variables in the risk assessment. The results of this model simulation emphasize the need, in a geographic and ethnic setting such as San Diego County, for specific interventions including education and outreach programs for those at risk.","1997","California","None","None"
"Associations between soil lead and childhood blood lead in urban New Orleans and rural Lafourche Parish of Louisiana","This study evaluates associations between soil lead concentrations (SPb), age of housing, and blood lead levels (BPb) of children in metropolitan New Orleans and Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. The database includes over 2,600 SPb and 6,000 BPb samples paired by their median values and pre-1940 housing percentages for 172 census tracts. Associations were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and Spearman's rho test and modeled with the least sum of absolute deviations regression. Census tracts with low SPb are associated with new housing, but census tracts with high SPb are evenly split between old and new housing [Fisher's exact test, p = 8.60 X 10(-13) for the percentage of housing built before 1940 (percent pre-1940 housing) versus SPb]. The p-value for SPb versus BPb is 12 orders of magnitude stronger than the p-value for percent pre-1940 housing versus BPb. Census tracts with low BPb are associated with new housing, but census tracts with high BPb are split evenly between old and new housing (Fisher's exact test, p = 1. 67 X 10(-12) for percent pre-1940 housing versus BPb). Census tracts with high SPb are associated with high BPb and census tracts with low SPb are associated with low BPb (Fisher's exact test, p = 3.18 X 10(-24) for BPb versus SPb). The Spearman's rho test of the association of SPb and BPb in Orleans and Lafourche Parishes yielded a p-value of 6.12 X 10(-24). The least sum of absolute deviations regression model of the data is BPb = 1. 845 + 0.7215 (SPb)0.4. A comparison of the modeled BPb versus observed BPb has an r(2) of 0.552 and a p-value of 2.83 X 10(-23) that this relation was due to chance. If blood lead in children is more closely associated to soil lead than to the age of housing, then primary lead prevention should also include soil lead.","1997","Louisiana","soil","soil"
"Childhood lead poisoning and vinyl miniblind exposure","Objective: To determine the contribution of vinyl miniblinds to childhood lead poisoning. Design: A descriptive investigation was undertaken to estimate attributable risk among all reported childhood lead poisoning cases in North Carolina for which home environmental sampling was conducted between March and August 1996. Participants: Ninety-two children, aged 6 to 72 months, identified through a statewide screening program were included. Blood lead and environmental sampling test results were obtained from routine surveillance data collected for all lead-poisoned children. Results: Exposure to vinyl miniblinds with dust lead levels of 100 mu g/ft(2) or more occurred for 44 (48%) of the lead-poisoned children; 25 (27%) of the children were exposed to levels of 500 mu g/ft(2) or more. Vinyl miniblinds were the predominant source tie, other major sources of lead were not identified) for 8 (9%) of the children. Overall, the median dust lead level for vinyl miniblind field samples was 590 mu g/ft(2), and the highest level reported was 73 302 mu g/ft(2). Even new vinyl miniblinds manufactured before July 1996 contained dust lead levels that on average exceeded 100 mu g/ft(2). The levels for recently available nonleaded vinyl miniblinds were below the limits of detection. Conclusions: Vinyl miniblinds, introduced into this country 10 years ago, with sales estimated at 30 million sets a year, include brands containing lead. Although new formulations with no lead added are available, millions of children may still be at risk because a product recall has not been issued tie, lead-contaminated vinyl miniblinds are still in general use). In addition, the risk assessment evaluations proposed in lieu of universal blood lead screening for low-risk communities could overlook children with exposure to this source.","1997","North Carolina","None","None"
"Suspected lead poisoning in a public school","Reports of lead exposure can generate considerable public concern, particularly when children are involved. In December, 1996, a public elementary school in rural Utah was found to have elevated concentrations of lead in its drinking water. The local public health department responded by instituting remediation of the water supply and by warning parents of the possible danger to their children. Subsequent blood lead testing in 116 of the approximately 300 children involved showed an average lead concentration in the range expected for the U.S. population at large. One of the 116 specimens was marginally elevated and was probably unrelated to the school drinking water. Reducing lead exposure is an important public health concern which sometimes generates a response out of proportion to the danger involved.","1997","Utah","None","water"
"The failure of CDC screening questionnaire to efficiently detect elevated lead levels in a rural population of children","BACKGROUND: In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowered the level for lead toxicity from 25 micrograms/dL to 10 micrograms/dL and published guidelines recommending that all children be tested for blood lead level at 12 months of age and again, if possible, at 24 months. The guidelines also called for periodic universal screening of children between the ages of 6 and 72 months using the CDC's lead screening questionnaire. However, blindly following these recommendations may result in unnecessary patient discomfort, wasted time, and extra expense. According to the CDC guidelines, deviation from this practice requires the determination of the local prevalence of lead poisoning. The purpose of this study was to measure the local prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) and to assess the utility of the CDC's lead screening questionnaire in a rural setting. METHODS: Three hundred seventy-six children living on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona were studied. A consecutive series evaluation at well-child visits between the ages of 6 and 72 months was conducted using the CDC lead screening questionnaire and blood lead levels measured by anodic voltammetry. RESULTS: Of 376 children, 368 had their blood levels tested. Eight children tested positively with an EBLL of > or = 10 micrograms/dL for a prevalence of 2.2%. Three hundred twenty-three completed questionnaires; 83 (25.7%) of these children had false-positive results. The sensitivity and specificity of the CDC lead screening questionnaire were 42.9% and 73.7%, respectively. The positive predictive value of the questionnaire was 3.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In this rural population of children, the prevalence of lead poisoning was low, and the CDC lead screening questionnaire failed to efficiently identify those children with lead toxicity. Screening such a population using the CDC guidelines will result in unnecessary discomfort for children and will squander limited resources of time and money. Physicians who care for children should know the local prevalence of EBLL in order to effectively follow the CDC's recommendations for lead screening.","1997","Arizona","None","None"

"The effectiveness of a home cleaning intervention strategy in reducing potential dust and lead exposures","The changes in dust loading, lead loading and lead concentration, determined from vacuum samples and wipe samples collected during the Childhood Lead Exposure Assessment and Reduction Study (CLEARS) were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the cleaning protocol in homes of children found to have moderate lead poisoning, e.g. levels between 10-20 mu g/dL. The samples were collected at least twice, and in 65 homes three times, during the course of a year long intervention in homes where half were randomized into a group which received a standardized Lead Intervention program for lead reduction, and the other homes only received an Accident Intervention program. The homes with lead burdened children were located in Hudson County, New Jersey (primarily in Jersey City), and were referred to the CLEARS by a number of private and public sources. Each home had wipe sampling conducted with the LWW Sampler (patented), and vacuum sampling was completed using a device described by Wang et al. in Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene. The results were compared in two ways: (1) between the two intervention groups, and (2) over the time course of the intervention period. When compared to the values seen in the first visit vacuum sampling results showed statistically significant decreases in lead loading and dust loading by the third sampling visit for the Lead Intervention homes. Substantial reductions in lead loading and dust loading were also seen when the Lend Intervention values were compared to values obtained in the Accident Intervention homes over the course of the year long intervention. The wipe sampling results for the 65 homes with three visits found no significant reductions in dust loading and lead loading among any of the room surfaces sampled in the Accident Intervention homes. There were 75% and 50% reductions observed on the window sills and on the bedroom floors of the homes which participated in the Lead Intervention. The levels in the living room and the kitchen showed very little change in loadings. This appeared to be due to the fact these rooms were near a background or baseline value of 0.3 g/cm(2) and 0.12 mg/cm(2) for dust loading and lead, respectively. This was substantiated by the window sills and bedroom wipe sampling results since each surface approached these values by the third visit. Significant reductions in lead concentrations found in the wipe samples from the intervention homes appeared to be related to the absence of historically active sources of lead in these homes, rather than elimination of current sources. The results of the micro-environmental sampling program in CLEARS indicated that a year-long cleaning protocol can significantly decrease lead levels in rugs and on other exposed surfaces. This will reduce the potential for exposure to lead among the occupants, especially children, that come in contact with such surfaces.","1998","New Jersey","None","social"
"Community characteristics associated with elevated blood lead levels in children","OBJECTIVES: To identify community characteristics associated with children having elevated blood lead levels (> or = 10 micrograms/dL) and examine whether these characteristics can be used to identify children with elevated blood lead levels. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 20,296 children in Monroe County, New York (< 6 years old) who had blood lead testing in the first 12 months after statewide mandated reporting of blood lead tests began. DESIGN: A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of children's blood lead levels and community characteristics by using community characteristics of 653 census block groups. RESULTS: The following community level variables were associated with increased risk of elevated blood lead levels in children: residence within the city [odds ratio (OR), 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6, 2.7]; block groups with a higher proportion of individuals of Black race (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.4, 2.0); higher screening rate (OR, 1.9; CI, 1.6, 2.4); lower housing value (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.2, 2.0); housing built before 1950 (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.3, 1.8); higher population density (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.3, 1.8); higher rates of poverty (OR, 1.4; CI, 1.2, 1.8); lower percent of high school graduates (OR, 1.3; CI, 1.1, 1.6), and lower rates of owner-occupied housing (OR, 1.2; CI, 1.0, 1.4). Community characteristics were comparable with clinic-based individual risk assessment to identify children with elevated blood lead levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that community characteristics can be used to develop screening strategies to identify children who have elevated blood lead levels and shift our efforts toward identifying houses containing lead hazards before occupancy and before children are unduly exposed.","1998","New York","None","None"
"Relationship between soil and dust lead in a lead mining area and blood lead levels","The relationship between lead mining waste and childhood lead poisoning is poorly understood. This study evaluates the contribution of soil lead to blood lead levels. METHODS: 125 children between 6 and 71 months of age living in a lead mining area of southwestern Missouri were evaluated for blood lead and their homes tested for lead in soil, dust, and paint. These results were compared to 26 control children. RESULTS: Homes in the lead mining area had significantly increased soil and dust lead levels and significantly higher blood lead levels. The primary source of dust lead was soil lead. There was a strong relationship between blood lead levels and dust, soil, and paint lead. CONCLUSION: Soil lead related to mining operations plays a significant role in contributing to blood lead levels in children.","1998","Missouri","social","soil"
"A community outreach lead screening program using capillary blood collected on filter paper","OBJECTIVE: To test whether a method of fingerstick blood sample collection onto filter paper could be used as an alternative screening method in the field in settings where environmental lead contamination is a high risk. METHOD: Members of the Pediatric Mobile Team of Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, collected paired venous and capillary blood samples from 120 children, aged 6 months to 6 years, who presented for services at any of 7 sites located in decaying neighborhoods of older sections of Detroit. All samples were analyzed for lead content by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: When filter paper samples with blood lead levels of 0.48 micromol/L (10 microg/dL) or higher were compared with matched venous samples, the concordance coefficient was 0.96. The sensitivity and specificity of the filter paper samples relative to the venous samples for a cutoff of 0.48 micromol/L (10 microg/dL) or higher were 94% and 99%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 97%. However, at a cutoff of 0.72 micromol/L (15 microg/dL), the sensitivity and specificity dropped to 75% and 98%, respectively, with filter paper samples underreporting blood lead values. At any cutoff point (0.48, 0.72, or 0.96 micromol/L [10, 15, or 20 microg/dL]), the filter paper method was highly specific for lead. CONCLUSIONS: Capillary filter paper sampling is an accurate and practical alternative to venous sampling for blood lead screening using 0.48 micromol/L (10 microg/dL) as the cutoff. The filter paper method predicts levels of 0.72 micromol/L (15 microg/dL) or higher less well. The cause of divergent values above 0.72 micromol/L (15 microg/dL) is not clear. Environmental contamination of capillary filter paper, however, does not seem to be an explanation.","1998","Michigan","None","None"
"Health status of pediatric refugees in Portland, Me","Background: An understanding of the health conditions affecting pediatric refugees is essential to providing responsible health care for them when they arrive in the United States. Objective: To assess the health status of pediatric refugees in an area of increased refugee resettlement. Design: Retrospective medical records review. Setting: Ambulatory clinic at Maine Medical Center in Portland, a community and referral hospital. Patients: One hundred thirty-two refugees and immigrants aged 2 months through 18 years who had initial health care evaluations during 1994 and 1995. Results: Sixty-six patients arrived from Africa, 22 from the former Yugoslavia, and the remainder from the former Soviet Union, Middle Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The mean age of the patients was 10 years; 56 (42.4%) were female. The overall health status of most of the children was good, with most having appropriate weight and height for age. Dental caries and dermatologic conditions were the most prevalent findings on physical examination. Two patients had evidence of traumatic injuries. The results of tuberculin (Mantoux) tests were positive (greater than or equal to 10 mm) in 45 (35.2%) of 128 children for whom results were noted, hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in 5 (4.0%) of 124 children, and hepatitis B surface antibody was detected in 26 (21.1%) of 123 children. Five (16.7%) of 30 children younger than 6 years had elevated blood lead levels; anemia was detected in 25 (19.7%) of 127 children with hematocrit results available. Stool specimens were obtained from 87 patients, of whom 38 (43.7%) had pathogenic parasites in at least 1 specimen. Conclusions: Pediatric refugees arrive in the United States with a variety of conditions that may be unfamiliar to practitioners trained in this country. The results of this study support the screening of refugees from Africa and other regions for tuberculosis, stool parasites, and hepatitis B.","1998","Maine","None","None"
"Indoor and outdoor household dust contamination in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Despite some progress in reducing the average lead level in the USA, the streets of Cincinnati, Ohio, are still contaminated by heavy metals. High levels of heavy metals will have significant unequivocal ecological impacts and pose a potential health hazard. This study evaluates the level of heavy-metal contamination in household dust and examines its relationships with the external environment. Samples of outdoor and indoor dust were collected from middle-income residential homes in the Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan District and the metal content was analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry. Results showed that the mean levels of lead in outdoor and indoor dusts are 650 mu g g(-1) and 377 mu g g(-1) and the copper levels are 253 mu g g(-1) and 510 mu g g(-1), respectively. The median levels are 156 mu g g(-1) and 139 mu g g(-1) for outdoor and indoor lead dusts and 35 mu g g(-1) and 124 mu g g(-1) for outdoor and indoor copper dusts. The degree of contamination may be ascribable to the age of the dwelling unit and the neighbourhood, the time when the unit was last painted, the presence of pets and the type of space heating. In addition, car exhausts seems to be a possible source of contamination.","1998","Ohio","None","None"
"Prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in an inner-city pediatric clinic population","In November 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released revised guidelines for lead poisoning screening, including a recommendation that states and regions individualize screening policies based on local prevalence of elevated lead levels. The purpose of this study was to collect prevalence data for a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, inner-city pediatric outpatient population previously not known to have elevated blood lead levels in order to determine its risk for lead exposure and screening requirements. Charts were reviewed for 817 children of 10 months through 6 years of age whose venous blood lead levels were obtained as part of their routine health care over a 12-month period ending October 1992. None of these children had a history of previously elevated lead levels. Prevalence of elevated lead levels was determined for this population and correlated with patient age, sex, race, and insurance type. More than two-thirds (68%) of the study patients had a blood lead level of [Greater than and equal to]10 microg/dl. Elevated blood lead levels were associated with black race (p<0.0001), but not with sex or insurance type. The percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels was highest at ages 37-48 months. A majority of the children screened had lead levels in excess of the CDC threshold for an abnormal lead level (10 microgram/dl). This is the highest reported prevalence within a U.S. pediatric clinic population. In view of this extremely high prevalence, clinicians and public health personnel caring for children in Philadelphia inner-city clinics must follow the intent of the new CDC guidelines by increasing their efforts in the areas of screening, follow-up, and environmental interventions. To ensure a lead-safe upbringing for children in the United States, state health officials nationwide should perform local risk assessments before considering policy transitions from universal to targeted screening.","1998","Pennsylvania","None","None"

"Evaluation of risk assessment questions used to target blood lead screening in Illinois","OBJECTIVE: Beginning in 1995, Illinois law permitted targeted-as opposed to universal-blood lead screening in low-risk areas, which were defined by ZIP code characteristics. State guidelines recommended specific lead risk assessment questions to use when targeting screening. This study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Illinois lead risk assessment questions. DESIGN: Parents bringing their 9- or 10- or 12-month and 24-month-old children for health supervision visits at 13 pediatric practices and parents of children (aged 6 through 25 months and who needed a blood lead test) receiving care at 5 local health departments completed a lead risk assessment questionnaire concerning their child. Children had venous or capillary blood lead testing. Venous confirmation results of children with a capillary level >/=10 micrograms/dL were used in analyses. CHILDREN: There were 460 children with both blood and questionnaire data recruited at the pediatric practices (58% of eligible) and 285 children (51% of eligible) recruited at local health departments. Of the 745 children studied, 738 provided a ZIP code that allowed their residence to be categorized as in a low-risk (n = 456) or high-risk (n = 282) area. RESULTS: Sixteen children (3.5%) living in low-risk areas versus 34 children (12.1%) living in high-risk areas had a venous blood lead level (BLL) >/=10 micrograms/dL; 1.8% and 5.3%, respectively, had a venous BLL >/=15 micrograms/dL. For children living in low-risk areas, Illinois mandated risk assessment questions (concerning ever resided in home built before 1960, exposure to renovation, and exposure to adult with a job or hobby involving lead) had a combined sensitivity of.75 for levels >/=10 micrograms/dL and.88 for levels >/=15 micrograms/dL; specificity was.39 and.39, respectively. The sensitivity of these questions was similar among children from high-risk areas; specificity decreased to.27 and.28, for BLLs >/=10 micrograms/dL and >/=15 micrograms/dL, respectively. The combination of items requiring respondents to list house age (built before 1950 considered high risk) and indicate exposure to renovation had a sensitivity among children from low-risk areas of.62 for BLLs >/=10 micrograms/dL with specificity of.57; sensitivity and specificity among high-risk area children were.82 and.36, respectively. For this strategy, similar sensitivities and specificities for low and high-risk areas were found for BLLs >/=15 micrograms/dL. CONCLUSIONS: The Illinois lead risk assessment questions identified most children with an elevated BLL. Using these questions, the majority of Illinois children in low-risk areas will continue to need a blood lead test. This first example of a statewide screening strategy using ZIP code risk designation and risk assessment questions will need further refinement to limit numbers of children tested. In the interim, this strategy is a logical next step after universal screening.","1999","Illinois","None","None"
"A comparison of costs of universal versus targeted lead screening for young children","The purposes of this study were to compare universal blood lead screening for young children versus targeting by a risk assessment questionnaire and to examine the cost implications of each approach. Costs reflect the total number of blood tests required and cost of specimen collection, handling, and testing per elevated case. The setting included the metropolitan areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Children (N=9603) from 17 community organizations had blood tests. In addition, each child's parent or guardian completed a questionnaire assessing potential risk for lead poisoning. Four different screening approaches are presented. Each screening approach is presented with associated costs of overall screening and cost per child identified at blood levels of >/=10 microg/dl (N=1140) and >/=15 microg/dl (N=317). Based on the screening strategy selected and an estimate of $17 per blood test, total screening costs ranged from $91,596 to $165,945. The cost per child identified with elevated lead levels ranged from $361 to $523 at >/=15 and $105 to $146 at >/=10. Nine to 13% of children would not have been detected by policies other than universal screening. A geographically based approach was able to detect 90% of children with elevated blood levels at two-thirds the cost of universal screening. Blood tests would be taken for all children living within city limits. Those residing elsewhere would be tested only if answers to questionnaire items pertaining to age of housing, prior history of lead poisoning, or eating paint chips indicated risk. The new CDC guidelines suggest that screening be based on an assessment of housing, population demographics, and community risk and resources. This paper presents such an assessment.","1999","Minnesota","None","None"

"A retrospective examination of in-home educational visits to reduce childhood lead levels","A number of human health effects from lead are well known. However, the means for reducing lead exposure in children has been a subject of uncertainty. This paper presents results of a retrospective study of educational lead reduction interventions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for children who had elevated blood lead levels between 20 and 24 microg/dl. The study examined Milwaukee Health Department (MHD) records of baseline and follow-up blood lead measurements. A study group of children received an in-home educational visit by an MHD paraprofessional. The educational visits last about an hour and the importance of reducing lead exposure, nutritional suggestions, and dust clean-up practices and behavioral changes that can reduce lead exposure are discussed. After the intervention, the average observed blood lead level (n=187) declined by 4.2 microg/dl or by about 21%. A decline of 1.2 microg/dl (6%) was also observed in a reference group of 226 children who did not receive an MHD in-home visit. The decline in the reference group may be partially due to education at the clinics taking the blood samples. The study group had a decline in blood lead levels 3.1 microg/dl (15%) greater than the reference group, with the difference between groups being statistically significant with a P value of less than 0.001. Although significant exposures remained in most of the children studied, important lead reductions were observed with this relatively inexpensive and simple intervention. Education in the homes of families at risk for lead poisoning may be an effective component of programs to reduce blood lead levels.","1999","Wisconsin","None","None"
"Childhood blood lead screening in Arkansas: recommendations for health care providers","Multiple studies documenting regional differences in prevalence of elevated blood lead levels suggest that children are not at equal risk for lead exposure. In late 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines to help states and communities make decisions regarding screening practices. To apply these guidelines to Arkansas Department of Health blood lead data for the 8,883 screens completed in state fiscal year 1997, along with 1990 Census Bureau housing and poverty statistics, were compiled and reviewed. Based upon CDC criteria and other available information, conservative recommendations for blood lead screening are presented for each county in the state. Lead toxicity in children remains a significant public health concern in certain regions of the country. Between 1991-1994, it was estimated about 930,000 U.S. children one to five years old had lead levels > or = 10 micrograms/dL. Children most at risk include minorities, those residing in large central cities, and those living in poverty. Blood lead levels (BLL's) as low as 10 micrograms/dL have been linked with possible IQ deficits as well as learning and behavior problems. To date, no study has demonstrated benefit from reduction of blood lead levels in the 10-24 micrograms/dL range. Nonetheless, in 1991 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines for screening and followup designed to detect lead levels this low, presumably in order to prevent additional exposure and perhaps shorten the duration of toxicity. These guidelines essentially called for universal screening of one- and two-year old children regardless of socioeconomic status or previous population-based results of lead screening in their locale. [table: see text] Since release of the controversial 1991 guidelines, several reports of lead toxicity prevalence surveys from diverse communities have demonstrated extreme variation in the magnitude of the problem.

"Dietary calcium intakes of urban children at risk of lead poisoning","Dietary calcium is well known to decrease gastrointestinal lead absorption and thereby reduce the risk for lead poisoning. Because children in economically deprived urban centers are especially likely to have excessive lead exposure, we surveyed dietary calcium intakes of 314 children from the greater Newark, New Jersey, area. The areas of Newark and adjacent communities studied had been previously identified as containing significant sources of environmental lead by geographic information systems technology. An abbreviated National Cancer Institute Health Habits and History Questionnaire, modified to focus on foods high in calcium, was used to determine dietary calcium. Calcium intakes were then compared to the new Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) guidelines. The respondents were primarily the parents of African-American and Hispanic children ranging in age from 1 to 8 years, with a mean age of 3.5 years. The most recent blood lead concentration was 11.4 +/- 0.8 mu g/dL (mean +/- standard error), and 48.6% had concentrations at or above the current guideline of 10 mu g/dL. Quintiles of calcium intake were: 221 +/- 13; 488 +/- 9; 720 +/- 6; 885 +/- 6; and 1,389 +/- 49 mg/day. Fifty-five of 175 (31.4%) children aged 1-3 years had calcium intakes below the DRI, as did 82 of 139 (59.0%) children aged 4-8 years. The percentage of mothers reporting lactose intolerance in their children was 2.5%. The observation that the children in the highest quintile easily exceeded the DRIs for calcium suggests that urban parents who include dairy foods in their childrens' meals can provide a diet that meets the DRI guidelines. Children in the lowest quintiles are at risk of increased absorption of the environmental lead to which they are inevitably exposed, as well as other problems associated with a low intake of dietary calcium. The data suggest that both lead exposure and low dietary calcium continue to pose significant health risks to urban minority children.","1999","New Jersey","None","social"
"Calculating the interindividual geometric standard deviation for use in the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children","The integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (IEUBK) model, recommended for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at residential Superfund sites to predict potential risks to children from lead exposure and to establish lead remediation levels, requires an interindividual geometric standard deviation (GSD(i)) as an essential input parameter. The GSD(i) quantifies the variability of blood lead concentrations for children exposed to similar environmental concentrations of lead. Estimates of potential risks are directly related to the GSDi, and therefore the GSD(i) directly impacts the scope of remediation at Superfund sites. site-specific GSD(i) can be calculated for sites where blood lead and environmental lead have been measured. This paper uses data front blood and environmental lead studies conducted at the Bingham Creek and Sandy, Utah, Superfund sites to calculate GSD(i) using regression modeling, box modeling, and structural equation modeling. GSD(i)s were calculated using various methods for treating values below the analytical method detection and quantitation limits. Treatment of nonquantifiable blood lead concentrations affected the GSD(i) more than the statistical method used to calculate the GSD(i). For any given treatment, the different statistical methods produced similar GSD(i)s. Because of the uncertainties associated with data in the blood lead studies, we recommend that a range of GSD(i)s be used when analyzing site-specific risks associated with exposure to environmental lead instead of a single estimate. Because the different statistical methods produce similar GSD(i)s, we recommend a simple procedure to calculate site-specific GSD(i) from a scientifically sound blood and environmental lead study.","1999","Utah","None","None"
"Evaluations of primary metals from NHEXAS Arizona: distributions and preliminary exposures","NHEXAS AZ is a multimedia, multipathway exposure assessment survey designed to evaluate metals and other analytes. This paper reports the analyte-specific concentration distributions in each of the media examined (air, soil, house dust, food, beverage, and water), for various methodologies used (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and hydride generation-atomic absorption spectroscopy). Results are reported for the five primary metals (Pb, As, Cd, Cr, and Ni). Ingestion was the most important pathway of exposure. Metal concentrations in air were very low (ng/m(3)) and found only above the 90th percentile. Metals were commonly found in house dust and soil. Exposure transfer coefficients minimize the importance of this component for those over the age of 6 years. When ranked by exposure, food, beverage, and water appeared to be the primary contributors of metal exposure in NHEXAS AZ. For instance, at the 90th percentile, Pb was undetected in air, found at 131 and 118 mu g/m(3) in floor dust and soil, respectively, and measured at 16 mu g/kg in food, 7.1 mu g/kg in beverage, and 2.0 and 1.3 mu g/1 in drinking and tap water, respectively. We calculated preliminary estimates of total exposure (mu g/day) for each participant and examined them independently by age, gender, and ethnicity as reported by the subjects in the NHEXAS questionnaire. At the 90th percentile for Pb, total exposures were 64 mu g/day across all subjects (n = 176); adult men (n = 55) had the greatest exposure (73 mu g/day) and children (n = 35) the least (37 mu g/day). Hispanics (n = 54) had greater exposure to Pb (68 mu g/day) than non-Hispanics (n = 119; 50 mu g/day), whereas non-Hispanics had greater exposure for all other metals reported. These results have implications related to environmental justice. The NHEXAS project provides information to make informed decisions for protecting and promoting appropriate public health policy.","1999","Arizona","None","air"

We obtained blood lead by graphite furnace spectrophotometry on 1,571 children aged 6 months to 8 years. Nineteen percent of children had blood lead levels > or = 10 mcg/dL. Risk factors included African-American ethnicity, young age, and residence in old housing. Follow-up was accomplished in only 50% of children with low-level toxicity. Lead screening is an important public health measure in communities with old houses. For screening to be successful, caregivers need to devote additional effort to follow-up.","1999","Texas","None","None"
"The association between state housing policy and lead poisoning in children","OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of an active program of household lead paint hazard abatement, applied over 22 years, on childhood lead poisoning in Massachusetts. METHODS: A small areas analysis was used to compare screening blood lead levels of children in Worcester County, Mass (n = 27,590), with those in Providence County, RI (n = 19,071). Data were collapsed according to census tract. RESULTS: The percentage of children with lead poisoning (blood lead level > or = 20 micrograms/dL [Pe20]) was, on average, 3 times higher in Providence County census tracts (3.2% vs 0.9% in Worcester County census tracts, P < .0001), despite similar percentages of pre-1950s housing in both counties. The ratio of Pe20 in Providence vs Worcester County census tracts was 2.2 (95% confidence interval = 1.8, 2.7), after adjustment for differences in housing, sociodemographic, and screening characteristics. This estimate was robust to alternative regression methods and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Massachusetts policy, which requires lead paint abatement of children's homes and places liability for lead paint poisoning on property owners, may have substantially reduced childhood lead poisoning in that state.","1999","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Is universal screening for lead in children indicated?

In order to determine whether we should continue our institution's present policy of universal screening, we analyzed 962 lead samples obtained by routine screening in the calendar year 1997, 83 children (8.6%) had elevated levels (over 10 mcg/dl) by capillary samples; of the 57 children who had follow up tests by venipuncture, 35 had abnormal levels making the incidence of elevated leads in our screened children 3.6%. Most of the abnormal levels were in African-American children living in two downtown zip codes.

"Acquisition and retention of lead by young children","The concentrations and isotope ratios of lead in blood and urine, on the hands, and in duplicate diet samples were measured for children living in Omaha, Nebraska. One group consisted of 22 children followed from birth to between 1 and 2 years of age and another group was 20 2- to 4-year-old children followed for 1 year, although some in each group were followed for periods between 3 and 4 years. At no time in life was a component of dietary lead identified in blood by isotope ratios, and blood lead appears dominated by lead derived from the hands, which in turn appears derived from the floors. For some homes floor lead appeared to be a mixture of lead from window sills and from the exterior. Only 2 of the children appear to have ingested lead directly from window sills. Several who lived in homes being remodeled were exposed to lead before the age of 2 years. For those who had been briefly exposed during professional remodeling the blood lead fell with a half-life of 10 months but for those who had suffered prolonged exposure during remodeling by parents the apparent half-life was longer, between 20 and 38 months.","2000","Nebraska","None","None"
"Emissions of lead and zinc from candles with metal-core wicks","We measured the amount of lead released from 14 different brands of candles with metal-core wicks sold in Michigan. The emissions of lead were found to range from 0.5 to 66 mu g/h, and the rates for zinc were from 1.2 to 124 mu g/h. It is estimated that burning four of the candles bought in Michigan for 2 h can result in airborne lead concentrations that can pose a threat to human health. In addition to inhalation of lead in the air, children get exposed to lead in candle fumes deposited on the floor, furniture and walls through their hand-to-mouth activity. Burning candles with leaded-core wick may be an important exposure route for lead that has generally been ignored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.","2000","Michigan","None","air"
"Assessment of a lead management program for inner-city children","Lead poisoning is a significant health problem among some children living in inner-city homes in Toledo, Ohio, and elsewhere. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided a three-year grant to the city of Toledo for an environmental lead remediation program. This study retrospectively reviewed records of houses contaminated with lead and blood-lead levels (BLLs) in children for the period January 1995 to August 1998. The authors then evaluated the sources of lead exposure and the influence of chelation therapy and parent lead education on children's BLLs. The children who participated in this study lived in the inner city and were from low-income families. They occupied pre-1950 houses with lead based paint concentrations that in some areas were greater than 9.9 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm(2)), well exceeding the HUD guideline of 1.0 mg/cm(2). Levels of lead dust in soil and on surfaces in homes also were greater than the respective HUD guidelines of 400 micrograms per gram (mug/g) and 100 to 800 microgram per square foot (mug.ft(2)). About 88 percent of the 165 children evaluated had elevated BLLs-that is, BLLs greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL). Among children who received chelation therapy, the postchelation mean BLL was statistically lower (p < .001) than the prechelation mean BLL, but it remained elevated. Among nonchelated children, the mean BLL at the final screening was statistically,higher (p < .001) than the mean BLL at initial screenings, These results suggest that chelation alone was not sufficient to lower the concentration of lead in children's blood to an acceptable level (less than 10 mug/dL) and that the single visit a health care worker made to each home to educate the parents about lead was inadequate. Both chelated and nonchelated children continued to occupy lead-contaminated homes through the duration of the study. Accordingly the authors draw three conclusions: Chelation therapy and parent education about lead do not always adequately lower children's BLLs if exposure continues. Parents should receive more frequent and more comprehensive education about lead. Residence in lead-free homes remains the most effective option to control children's BLLs.","2000","Ohio","None","soil"
"Methods of exposure assessment: Lead-contaminated dust in Philadelphia schools","This study was conducted to develop a method that would accurately assess children's exposure to lead in schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We examined three wipe sample protocols: one included accessible surfaces such as desktops and windowsills, the second included inaccessible surfaces such as the top of filing cabinets and light fixtures, and the third included hand wipes of the study participants. Surface wipes were collected at 10 locations from accessible and inaccessible classroom surfaces (n = 11 at each location) and from the palms of student subjects in the same locations (n = 168). We found a significant difference in lead dust concentrations determined by the three protocols (F = 4.619; 2,27 degrees of freedom; p = 0.019). Lead dust concentrations were significantly elevated at the inaccessible surfaces yet they were uniformly low on the accessible surfaces and the children's palms. These findings were consistent with observed changes in blood lead levels of study participants: after 6 months of exposure to the study locations, 156 of 168 children experienced no change in blood lead level, whereas 12 experienced only a minimal change of 1-2 mu g/dL. The mere presence of lead in inaccessible dust in the school environment does not automatically constitute a health hazard because there may not be a completed exposure pathway.","2000","Pennsylvania","None","None"

"Long-term effect of dust control on blood lead concentrations","BACKGROUND: Dust control is recommended to prevent children's exposure to residential lead hazards, but the long-term effect of dust control on children's exposure to environmental lead is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of dust control on children's exposure to lead, as measured by blood lead concentration at 48 months of age. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial. Setting. Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 275 urban children were randomized at 6 months of age; 189 (69%) were available for the 48-month follow-up blood test. Intervention. Children and their families were randomly assigned to an intervention group that received cleaning equipment and up to 8 visits by a trained lead hazard control advisor or to a control group. The intervention was terminated when the children were 24 months of age. OUTCOME MEASURES: Geometric mean blood lead concentration and prevalence of elevated blood lead concentration (ie, >/=10 microg/dL, >/=15 microg/dL, and >/=20 microg/dL), by group assignment. RESULTS: For children with 48-month blood tests, baseline geometric mean blood lead concentrations were 2.8 microg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 3.0); there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or lead exposure by group assignment. At 48 months of age, the geometric mean blood lead was 5.9 microg/dL (95% CI: 5.3, 6.7) for the intervention group and 6.1 microg/dL (95% CI: 5.5,6.9) for the control group. The percentage of children with a 48-month blood lead >/=10 microg/dL, >/=15 microg/dL, and >/=20 microg/dL was 19% versus 19%, 2% versus 9%, and 1% versus 2% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that dust control, as performed by families and in the absence of lead hazard controls to reduce ongoing contamination from lead-based paint, was not effective in preventing children's exposure to residential lead hazards.","2000","New York","None","None"
"The relationship between residential lead exposures and elevated blood lead levels in a rural mining community","A 80-year history of lead mining iu rural northeastern Oklahoma has resulted in widespread coverage of residential areas with mine waste from mined blown dispersion of mined materials and deliberate use of tailings in construction and road maintenance. For this study, environmental samples (soil, dust, paint, water) were collected with standardized techniques from a population based random sample of 245 residences as part of a blood lead screening project. Nearly SO percent of study homes contained lead-based paint, Lead in floor dust exceeded the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) standard in approximately 10 percent of the homes, and in over 20 percent, yard soils had lead levels above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) standard, Multivariate analysis of environmental and blood lead data found that four variables were independently associated with elevated blood lead levels: floor dust (odds ratio [OR] = 8.1, and confidence interval [CI] = 1.8, 37.8); yard soil (OR = 6.4, and CI = 1.4, 30.7); interior paint (OR = 3.0, and CI = 1.2, 7.8); and location of residence (OR = 3.4, and CI = 1.3, 8.8), These data demonstrate that effective residential remediation strategies must address paint, dust, and yard soils, The environmental assessment also found that nearly 20 percent of homes outside the mining area had contaminated soil, indicating that soil remediation efforts will have to extend beyond the current boundaries of the Superfund site.","2000","Oklahoma","None","water"
"Survey of selected activities relevant to exposures to soils","In the summer and fall of 1996, a survey of randomly selected U.S. households was conducted by computer assisted telephone interview (CATT). The primary purpose of the survey, dubbed Soil Contact Survey (SCS-I), was quantification of behavioral patterns pertinent to dermal exposure to soil. Results of the survey and a follow-up (SCS-II) conducted in 1998 have been applied to estimation of a metric of dermal soil exposure termed the soil contact rate (SCR). Partial results have been presented elsewhere (Garlock et al., 1999; Wong et al., in press). The purpose of this paper is dissemination of selected data gathered in SCS-I that have not been formally incorporated in SCR estimation, but are of potential interest to exposure assessors. In SCS-I, respondents were questioned regarding multiple activities potentially relevant to evaluation of residential exposure to soil. Data presented here describe frequency of consumption of homegrown produce, frequency of shoe removal prior to residence entry, type of floor covering, indoor/outdoor pet ownership, occurrence of bare yard soil and residential proximity to vacant lots or fields. Ingestion of foods grown in home gardens is of concern because local soil contamination may lead to elevated exposures (USEPA, 1997a). Chemical contaminants in soil may be transferred to plant tissues by absorption or adsorption (McKone, 1994). Produce may also be a vehicle for ingestion of soil not washed from edible plant surfaces. A survey performed by the National Gardening Association reported that 34 million U.S. households (38 percent of the total) participated in vegetable gardening in 1986 (USEPA, 1997a). Tomatoes, peppers, onions, cucumbers, lettuce, beans, carrots, and corn are the most commonly grown vegetables. EPA analysis of USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) data from 1987-88 produced estimates that 18% of U.S. citizens greater than or equal to 1 year of age consume homegrown vegetables and 8% consume homegrown fruit (USEPA,1997a). Residential exposures to contaminants in outdoor soils may occur indoors if house dust is impacted by track-in of soil. House dust is considered to be a mixture of biologically-derived material, deposited aerosols and soil particles brought in by foot traffic (Thatcher and Layton, 1995; USEPA, 1997b). The fraction attributable to outdoor soil has been estimated to be 30 to 40 percent (Fergusson and Kim, 1991). Outdoor soil and indoor dust lead levels have been found to be positively associated (Rabinowitz and Bellinger, 1988; Thornton et al, 1990; Berny et al., 1994). Thatcher and Layton (1995) studied ""tracked"" and ""untracked"" areas of floor surfaces and found that areas subject to foot traffic showed higher accumulation (mass/area) of dust. Nishioka et al. (1996) demonstrated transfer of herbicide from treated turf to carpet in a track-in simulation. Due to size selection, lack of degradation indoors other factors, contaminants may become enriched in house dusts. For instance, pesticide levels in indoor dust were found to be much higher than in outdoor soils in an agricultural community in Washington state (Simcox et al., 1995). Shoe removal has been hypothesized to reduce soil track-in (Ott and Roberts, 1998; Roberts et at., 1999). Pets may assist children with access to soil by digging or by accumulating soil and dust in their fur. Pets with access to both the indoors and outdoors can also bring outdoor soil and dust into the home. Thomas et al. (1976) linked increased blood lead levels in dogs with increased blood lead levels in children aged 1 to 6 in the same households. Berny et al. (1995) found a similar result for dogs and/or cars. The strongest association occurred in the youngest age group (children less than or equal to 6) with ""mostly inside"" pets. Type of floor covering may also be important in assessing exposure to house dust and related contaminants. Carpets appear to act as storage reservoirs for some persistent contaminants (Lewis et al., 1994; Whitmore et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1999). Carpeted areas also typically have higher dust mass per unit area than uncarpeted areas (Thatcher and Layton, 1995). Patches of bare soil in yards provide easy access to soil. Hwang et al. (1997) reported an association between urinary arsenic in children and soil arsenic in bare spots in yards. Residential proximity to vacant lots or fields is of interest because vacant land represents a possible opportunity for exposure to bare soils for children who are otherwise locally restricted to well maintained yards or to paved surfaces. Vacant lots may also have a history of use as dumping grounds due to lack of oversight.","2000","Washington","soil","soil"
"Children in Illinois with elevated blood lead levels, 1993-1998, and lead-related pediatric hospital admissions in Illinois, 1993-1997","OBJECTIVE: This study uses screening and hospitalization data to describe the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning in Chicago and the rest of the state of Illinois. METHODS: The authors used aggregate data published by the Illinois Department of Public Health on blood lead testing of children ages 0-6 years and data on lead-related hospital admissions of children ages 0-6 years, drawn from an administrative dataset compiled as part of a state initiative. RESULTS: No clear time trends in the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels (defined as >15 micrograms per deciliter [microg/dL] or >45 microg/dL) were evident in either Chicago or the rest of Illinois. The proportions of children with elevated blood lead levels in Chicago and in the rest of Illinois did not decline at the dramatic rate seen in the US as a whole during the 1990s. Over a five-year period, in-hospital charges of $7.7 million were generated for the care of lead-poisoned children ages 6-16 in Chicago alone. CONCLUSION: Surveillance data, analyzed at the appropriate geographic level, can be used to focus resources on high-risk areas and to evaluate prevention efforts.","2000","Illinois","None","None"
"Wisconsin children at risk for lead poisoning","The 1999 US Government Accounting Agency (GAO) report to Congress documented that among children in the United States, those served by federal health care programs had high rates of lead poisoning but low rates of blood lead testing. To further explore these findings, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services initiated matching the state's blood lead test data file with the Medicaid eligibility file, and with the WIC Program enrollment file. This article examines data analyzed from the matched files for the year 1999. The results of the analysis of Wisconsin data shadowed the national findings contained in the GAO report. About half of the Wisconsin children enrolled in Medicaid and WIC have been screened, the majority of lead poisoned children in Wisconsin receive Medicaid (80%) and WIC (60%) services. Additional data collected by the department on the physical and environmental health of severely lead-poisoned children indicates that lead-coated surfaces and deterioration were identified as the primary source and cause of the poisoning. These findings support the Wisconsin recommendations for blood lead testing of 1 and 2 year olds living in older or renovated housing, and all children enrolled in Medicaid or WIC.","2000","Wisconsin","None","None"
"Targeting lead screening: The Ohio Lead Risk Score","OBJECTIVE: Annual blood lead (BPb) screening is recommended for children </=2 years of age residing in high-risk areas. Strategies for identifying these areas exist but lack specificity. We sought to develop an efficient method for identifying risk factors for undue lead exposure in children by using community variables. DESIGN: Logistic regression for model development in one half of the sample followed by validation of the model in the remaining half. METHODS: The association between selected census tract characteristics from 19 Ohio counties and the BPb test results of children living in those census tracts was evaluated. The dependent variable, high-risk status, was defined as a census tract with >/=12% of BPb test results >/=10 microg/dL. RESULTS: Data from 897 census tracts were available. Higher risk for lead toxicity existed in areas where: 1) >/=55% of houses were built before 1950 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 10.9 [6.1,19.6]); 2) >/=35% of residents were black (AOR: 3.5 [2.0,6. 3]); 3) >/=35% of residents had less than a high school education (AOR: 6.1 [3.6,10.4]); and 4) >/=50% of housing units were renter-occupied (AOR: 3.6 [2.1,6.2]). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated no significant differences after applying the model in a second dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Several community characteristics predict risk for lead toxicity in children and may provide a useful approach to focus lead screening, especially in communities where public health resources are limited. The approach described here may also prove helpful in identifying factors within a community associated with other environmental public health hazards for children.","2000","Ohio","None","social"
"Lead-contaminated imported tamarind candy and children's blood lead levels","In 1999, an investigation implicated tamarind candy as the potential source of lead exposure for a child with a significantly elevated blood lead level (BLL). The Oklahoma City-County Health Department tested two types of tamarind suckers and their packaging for lead content. More than 50% of the tested suckers exceeded the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Level of Concern for lead in this type of product. The authors calculated that a child consuming one-quarter to one-half of either of the two types of suckers in a day would exceed the maximum FDA Provis onal Tolerable Intake for lead. High lead concentrations in the two types of wrappers suggested leaching as a potential source of contamination. The authors used the Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) model to predict the effects of consumption of contaminated tamarind suckers on populat on BLLs. The IEUBK model predicted that consumption of either type of sucker at a rate of one per day would result in dramatic increases in mean BLLs for children ages 6-84 months in Oklahoma and in the percentage of children wth elevated BLLs (> or =10 micrograms per deciliter [microg/dL]). The authors conclude that consumption of these products represents a potential public health threat. In addition, a history of lead contamination in imported tamarind products suggests that import control measures may not be completely effective in preventing additional lead exposure.","2000","Oklahoma","None","None"
"Association of silicofluoride treated water with elevated blood lead","Previous epidemiological studies have associated silicofluoride-treated community water with enhanced child blood lead parameters. Chronic, low-level dosage of silicofluoride (SiF) has never been adequately tested for health effects in humans. We report here on a statistical study of 151,225 venous blood lead (VBL) tests taken from children ages 0-6 inclusive, living in 105 communities of populations from 15,000 to 75,000. The tests are part of a sample collected by the New York State Department of Children's Health, mostly from 1994-1998. Community fluoridation status was determined from the CDC 1992 Fluoridation Census. Covariates were assigned to each community using the 1990 U.S. Census. Blood lead measures were divided into groups based on race and age. Logistic regressions were carried out for each race/age group, as well as above and below the median of 7 covariates to test the relationship between known risk factors for lead uptake, exposure to SiF-treated water, and VBL >10 microg/dL. RESULTS: For every age/race group, there was a consistently significant association of SiF treated community water and elevated blood lead. Logistic regressions above and below the median value of seven covariates show an effect of silicofluoride on blood lead independent of those covariates. The highest likelihood of children having VBL> 10 microg/dL occurs when they are both exposed to SiF treated water and likely to be subject to another risk factor known to be associated with high blood lead (e.g., old housing). Results are consistent with prior analyses of surveys of children's blood lead in Massachusetts and NHANES III. These data contradict the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the toxic effects of SiF and sodium fluoride, pointing to the need for chemical studies and comprehensive animal testing of water treated with commercial grade silicofluorides.","2000","Massachusetts","water","water"
"Use of geographic information system technology to aid Health Department decision making about childhood lead poisoning prevention activities","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that local public health agencies use local data to identify children at risk for lead exposure to ensure that they receive preventive services. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of a geographic information system (GIS) in identifying children at risk for lead exposure. We conducted a descriptive study, using GIS technology, of the blood lead (BPb) levels and residential location of at-risk children screened for lead exposure. ""At-risk children"" were defined as those children living in housing built before 1950 or in an area with a high proportion of older housing. The study was conducted in Jefferson County, Kentucky, USA. Participants were the cohort of children born in 1995 and screened from 1996 through 1997, and children younger than age 7 years who were screened from 1994 through 1998. Outcome measures were the BPb level and residential location (address or target zone) of at-risk children screened from 1996 through 1997, and the number and location of homes where more than one child had been poisoned by lead from 1994 through 1998. The proportion of children screened who live within zones targeted for universal screening varied from 48% to 53%, while only 50% of the at-risk children in the entire county were screened. Between 1994 and 1998, 79 homes housed 35% of the 524 children with lead poisoning. These housing units were prioritized for lead-hazard remediation. Significant numbers of at-risk children throughout the county were not being tested for lead exposure, even in prioritized areas. GIS can be very useful to health departments in planning lead exposure screening strategies and measuring program performance.","2001","Kentucky","None","None"
"Dorchester lead-safe yard project: A pilot program to demonstrate low-cost, on-site techniques to reduce exposure to lead-contaminated soil","Despite a general reduction in blood lead levels in children after lead was banned in gasoline and paint, lead poisoning remains an important health problem in many older urban areas. One factor that increases risk in these places is the high levels of lead in certain residential areas. A major intervention study found that reducing lead levels in urban soils results in a reduction in exposed children's blood lead levels. Removing lead from inner-city soils or reducing exposures to lead-contaminated soils typically is expensive, technologically challenging, or beyond the ability of low-income households to undertake. This project, in conjunction with residents and community-based institutions, developed a series of in situ, low-cost, low-technology measures that worked to reduce the exposure to lead-contaminated soils in one Boston, Massachusetts, neighborhood. The project demonstrated several important results. Government, universities, residents, and community based organizations can work together effectively to reduce exposures to lead in soil. Lead-contaminated soil can be mitigated at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods in ways that increase the ability of residents, community health centers, and others to have a positive impact on their neighborhoods. A lead-safe yard program can be replicated and institutionalized by municipal home de-leading programs and other community organizations.","2001","Massachusetts","soil","soil"
"Trends in blood lead levels among children--Boston, Massachusetts, 1994-1999","Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and national childhood blood lead surveillance data from 19 states indicated that average blood lead levels (BLLs) in young children decreased during the late 1990s (1-3). The proportion of children tested who had BLLs >10 microg/dL declined from 10.5% in 1996 to 7.6% in 1998, although the proportion was higher in certain counties (3). To determine whether a similar decline had occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, where a high proportion of children are tested each year, and whether any changes were similar in high- and low-risk neighborhoods, CDC, in collaboration with the Boston Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (BCLPPP) performed an analysis of BLLs among children aged 6-72 months in Boston during 1994-1999. The results indicate that BLLs in Boston declined during this period, but because of the geographic variation in lead exposure, continued surveillance will be necessary to eliminate childhood lead poisonings.","2001","Massachusetts","None","None"
"The effects of home lead abatements on childhood blood lead levels: A retrospective follow-up study","Home abatement is the environmental intervention most commonly mandated by law for children with lead poisoning. Previous studies of abatement efficacy, however, have yielded inconsistent results and have left doubt about the long-term effectiveness of this intervention in reducing children's blood lead levels. For this study, the authors analyzed 488 children six years old or less who had been reported to the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services from 1993 to 1997 with blood lead levels of 30 to 44 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL); each of the children analyzed also had a follow-up blood lead test at least two months after abatement if an abatement was completed, or two months after baseline if an abatement was not completed. Although home abatements were recommended for all children, they were not completed in 118 cases. A significant difference (p < .01) was seen in the mean declines of blood lead levels between children in abated homes (-10.1 mug/dL, or -28.5 percent) and those in unabated homes (-7.3 mug/dL, or -20.8 percent). This difference was partially due to longer follow up in the group that received abatement. When this difference was adjusted in a multiple regression for age, time to follow up, baseline blood lead level, socioeconomic factors, and season-with time to follow-up restricted to 70-400 days-the overall difference in decline of blood lead levels decreased from 7.7 percent to two percent, When the same restriction was applied,vith adjustment for the same confounders in a logistic regression and the probability of a decline of >4 mug/dL was modeled, abatement had minimal effect (odds ratio = 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval = 0.7, 2.5), Thus, lead paint abatements, as required in New Jersey from 1993 to 1997, are of only modest efficacy in reducing children's blood lead levels. Stronger regulations, better enforcement, and more attention to lead-contaminated dust should be evaluated as ways of better protecting lead-exposed children.","2001","New Jersey","None","None"
"The development of a stochastic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for lead","This presentation describes the development of a prototype Monte Carlo module for the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for lead, created by Dr Ellen O'Flaherty. The module uses distributions for the following: exposure parameters (soil and dust concentrations, daily soil and ingestion rate, water lead concentration, water ingestion rate, air lead concentration, inhalation rate and dietary lead intake); absoption parameters; and key pharmacokinetic parameters (red blood binding capacity and half saturation concentration). Distributions can be specified as time-invariant or can change with age. Monte Carlo model predicted blood levels were calibrated to empirically measured blood lead levels for children living in Midvale, Utah (a milling/smelting community). The calibrated model was then evaluated using blood lead data from Palmerton, Pennsylvania (a town with a former smelter) and Sandy, Utah, (a town with a former smelter and slag piles). Our initial evaluation using distributions for exposure parameters showed that the model accurately predicted geometric (GM) blood lead levels of Palmerton and Sandy and slightly over predicted the GSD. Consideration of uncertainty in red blood cell parameters substantially inflated the GM. Future model development needs to address the correlation among parameters and the use of parameters for long-term exposure derived from short-term studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Lead poisoning among refugee children resettled in Massachusetts, 1995 to 1999","Objective. Lead poisoning has been reported among immigrant and refugee populations in the United States; however, prevalences of elevated blood lead (BPb) and risk factors have not been described fully among newly arrived refugee children. This study was conducted to address this lack of data. Methods. We performed analysis of BPb levels among a cohort of refugee children, aged <7 years, who arrived in Massachusetts between July 1, 1995, and December 31, 1999. Gender, age, birthplace, time of year of lead testing, intestinal parasitoses, anemia, and growth retardation were examined as predictors of elevated BPb. Results. BPb levels <greater than or equal to>10 mg/dL were found in 11.3% of 693 children shortly after their arrival in the United States. Children from developing countries had the highest prevalences, including 27% of Somalis and Vietnamese. Country of birth was the strongest predictor of elevated BPb. No association between elevated lead and age was found. Among 213 children with BPb tests greater than or equal to6 months after the initial test, 7% had newly elevated levels of greater than or equal to 10 mug/dL. Conclusions. The prevalence of elevated BPb levels in recently arrived refugee children is more than twice that of US-born children. Children who are at particular risk are those from developing countries where environmental exposures are more ubiquitous. In addition, a significant percentage of refugees acquired elevated levels after arrival, thus suggesting the importance of follow-up testing of refugee children. Refugee status should be considered a risk factor for lead poisoning.","2001","Massachusetts","None","None"
"A statewide assessment of lead screening histories of preschool children enrolled in a Medicaid managed care program","OBJECTIVES: Despite the prominence of lead poisoning as a public health problem, recent Government Accounting Office reports indicate that only one fifth of children who are covered by Medicaid have been screened for lead poisoning. The purpose of this study was to examine the lead screening histories of children who were enrolled in a statewide, Medicaid managed care plan to determine the relative impact of the type of primary care provider site and family sociodemographic characteristics on the likelihood of being screened. The study also examined the prevalence of and risk factors for lead poisoning of children who had been screened. METHODS: A random sample of 2000 preschool-age children was chosen from those who were enrolled continuously in the statewide, expanded, Medicaid managed care program for a 1-year period and between the ages of 19 and 35 months at the end of that year. Sociodemographic characteristics and lists of primary care providers were obtained from administrative data sets. Medical record audits at primary care provider sites were performed to obtain the lead screening histories of the children, including test dates and results. RESULTS: Data on 1988 children were used for study analyses, and 80% of these children had at least 1 documented blood lead level. Children whose primary care provider was an office-based physician were less likely to be screened as compared with patients of health centers, hospital-based clinics, and staff model health maintenance organizations (68%, 86%, 89%, and 91% respectively). Variation in screening rates persisted in a multivariate analysis controlling for family sociodemographic characteristics and practice level variation. Of the 1587 children who had a documented blood lead test, 467 children (29%) had a blood lead level of >/=10 mg/dL on at least 1 test. CONCLUSIONS: Blood lead screening rates in Rhode Island's Medicaid managed care program are dramatically higher than national estimates for children who are enrolled in Medicaid. Potential explanations for this finding are 1) a high sensitization to the problem of lead poisoning in Rhode Island, 2) the primary care focus of the Medicaid program in Rhode Island facilitates the delivery of preventive services, and 3) the medical record audit approach used in this study was more comprehensive in identifying blood lead screens than techniques used in national studies. The high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels found in this study emphasizes the importance of screening among children who are enrolled in Medicaid.","2001","Rhode Island","None","None"
"Should we screen for lead poisoning after 36 months of age? Experience in the inner city","Introduction.-Current lead screening guidelines recommend monitoring lead levels in children under 3 years of age. There are, however. a number of children between the ages of 3 and 6 years who have elevated blood lead levels. Whether these lead elevations are new or chronic has not been examined. Objective.-To determine the proportion of children with lead levels greater than or equal to 10 mug/dL after their third birthday when all prior testing had been normal. Methods.-Retrospective study based on 39 000 venous lead tests obtained between 1993 and 1998, Front this group, 2046 children were located who had blood lead levels of less than 10 mug/dL before 36 months and who had a followup lead level after 36 months. All lead assays were done by the City of New York laboratories. which had an intrasample variability of 13%. Results.-Sixty-six (3.2%) of the 2046 children showed an elevation in blood lead for the first time after their third birthday. The abnormal values ranged from 10 to 25 mug/dL. The majority (72%) of the screen-positive children, however, had lead levels of 10 to 12 mug/dL, and 63.3% of screen-positive children with repeat tests had lead levels that reverted to below 10 mug/dL. Conclusions.-The data indicate that some new cases of lead level elevations did occur after 3 years of age in this 'high-risk' community, however, the current study provides evidence that universal screening for lead poisoning beyond 3 years of age is not warranted in this community as it is not likely to pick Lip clinically important exposure.","2001","New York","None","None"
"Multiple metal contamination from house paints: Consequences of power sanding and paint scraping in new orleans","Power sanding exterior paint is a common practice during repainting of old houses in New Orleans, Louisiana, that triggers lead poisoning and releases more than Pb. In this study we quantified the Pb, zinc, cadmium, manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium, and vanadium in exterior paint samples collected from New Orleans homes (n = 31). We used interior dust wipes to compare two exterior house-painting projects. House I was measured in response to the plight of a family after a paint contractor power sanded all exterior paint from the weatherboards. The Ph content (similar to 130,000 mug Pb/g) was first realized when the family pet died; the children were hospitalized, the family was displaced, and cleanup costs were high. To determine the quantity of dust generated by power sanding and the benefits of reducing Pb-contaminated dust, we tested a case study house (house 2) for Pb (similar to 90,000 mug/g) before the project was started; the house was then dry scraped and the paint chips were collected. Although the hazards of Pb-based paints are well known, there are other problems as well, because other toxic metals exist in old paints. If house 2 had been power sanded to bare wood like house 1, the repainting project would have released as dust about 7.4 hg Pb, 3.5 kg Zn, 9.7 g Cd, 14.8 g Cu, 8.8 g Mn, 1.5 g Ni, 5.4 g Co, 2.4 g Cr, and 0.3 g V. The total tolerable daily intake (TTDI) for a child under 6 years of age is 6 mug Ph from all sources. Converting 7.4 kg Pb to this scale is vexing-more than 1 billion (10(9)) times the TTDI. Also for perspective, the one-time release of 7.4 x 10(9) mug of Plo dust from sanding compares to 50 x 10(9) mug of Ph dust emitted annually per 0.1 mile (0.16 km) from street traffic during the peak use of leaded gasoline. In this paper, we broaden the discussion to include an array of metals in paint sind underscore the need and possibilities for curtailing the release of metal dust.","2001","Louisiana","None","None"

"Lead sources, behaviors, and socioeconomic factors in relation to blood lead of native American and white children: A community-based assessment of a former mining area","Lead poisoning prevention requires knowledge of lead sources and of appropriate residential lead standards. Data are severely lacking on lead sources for Native American children, many of whom live in rural areas. Further, the relation of mining waste to blood lead concentrations (BPbs) of rural children is controversial. In collaboration with the eight tribes of northeastern Oklahoma, we assessed lead sources and their effects on BPbs for rural Native American and White children living in a former mining region. Venous blood lead, residential environmental (soil, dust, paint, water), and caregiver interview (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviors, socioeconomic conditions) data were obtained from a representative sample of 245 children 1-6 years of age. BPbs ranged from 1 to 24 mug/dL. There were no ethnic differences in BPbs (p = 0.48) nor any patterns of excess lead sources for Native American or White children. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that mean soil lead, mean floor lead loading, mouthing behaviors, caregivers' education, and residence in former mining towns were all strongly associated with BPbs. Logistic regression results showed mean floor dust lead loading >10.1 pg/ft(2) (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [0], 3.5-37.3), and yard soil lead >165.3 mg/kg (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.3-12.4) were independently associated with BPbs greater than or equal to10 mug/dL. We also found strong interactions between soil lead and poverty (p = 0.005), and dust and soil sources (p = 0.02). Our findings indicate that soil and dust lead derived largely from mining waste pose a health hazard to Native American and White children, and that current residential dust lead standards are insufficient to adequately protect children. Moreover, our finding that poor children are especially vulnerable to lead exposures suggests that residential standards should consider interactions among socioeconomic conditions and lead sources if environmental justice is to be achieved.","2002","Oklahoma","None","water"
"Mapping for prevention: GIS models for directing childhood lead poisoning prevention programs","Environmental threats to children's health-especially low-level lead exposure-are complex and multifaceted; consequently, mitigation of these threats has proven costly and insufficient and has produced economic and racial disparities in exposure among populations. Policy makers, public health officials, child advocates, and others currently lack the appropriate infrastructure to evaluate children's risk and exposure potential across a broad range of risks. Unable to identify where the highest risk of exposure occurs, children's environmental health programs remain mitigative instead of preventive. In this article we use geographic information system spatial analysis of data from blood lead screening, county tax assessors, and the U.S. Census to predict statistically based lead exposure risk levels mapped at the individual tax parcel unit in six counties in North Carolina. The resulting model uses weighted risk factors to spatially locate modeled exposure zones, thus highlighting critical areas for targeted intervention. The methods presented here hold promise for application and extension to the other 94 North Carolina counties and nationally, as well as to other environmental health risks.","2002","North Carolina","None","social"
"Lead-based paint health risk assessment in dependent children living in military housing","OBJECTIVE: In children, lead can cause serious permanent damage as a neurotoxicant. The objectives of the study were to evaluate potential exposure to lead-based paint in family housing units at a typical U.S. military installation and determine blood lead (PbB) levels in children ages 6 years or younger residing in these housing units. METHODS: The authors conducted a risk assessment of 1,723 housing units and occupants at Fort Devens in Massachusetts. Data from the military dependent cohort was compared to estimates for the U.S. national population as reported from Phase 1 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). RESULTS: A total of 1992 individuals (1,009 males and 983 females) were screened for PbB, stratified into age groups, and separated into racial/ethnic categories. Four (0.3%) dust samples and 59 (11.6%) internal and 298 (77.8%) external paint chip samples contained hazardous levels of lead. The geometric mean PbB concentration for people ages 1 year and older reported by NHANES III was 2.8 micro g/dL, compared with 1.5 microg/dL for the military installation cohort (p<0.0001). PbB levels were higher for males than for females and higher for blacks than whites 6 years of age and older. Hispanics had lower PbB concentrations for all age groups except for those ages 1-2.9 years. Prevalence of PbB levels >10 microg/dL for all age groups was 1.6% in the military cohort, compared with 4.5% for the general population. For ages 1-2.9 years, no blacks or Hispanics and 0.6% of whites had PbB levels >10 micro g/dL, compared with 21.6% of blacks, 10.1% of Hispanics, and 8.5% of whites for the general population. For ages 3-5.99 years, 0.15% of blacks, 0% of Hispanics, and 0.3% of whites had PbB levels > or = 10 microg/dL, compared with 20.0% of blacks, 6.8% of Hispanics, and 3.7% of whites for the general population.

Currently, about 2,000 children a year in Minnesota are identified as having elevated blood lead (greater than 10 micrograms/dL). The Minnesota Department of Health has developed statewide guidelines for screening, case management, and clinical treatment of children who have been exposed to lead. The screening guidelines target children with the highest risk of exposure. The case management guidelines provide information to public health agencies on recommended steps for dealing with an elevated blood lead case. The clinical treatment guidelines assist physicians and other health care professionals with the medical aspects of a lead case.

We compared the lead loading reductions of these two vacuum cleaners in a total of 127 New Jersey homes of lead-exposed children. We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA vacuum cleaners resulted in 54.7% (p = 0.006) and 36.4% (p = 0.020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two vacuum cleaners was not statistically significant (p = 0.293). The wipe sampling data did not show any significant lead loading reduction for either of the vacuum cleaners, suggesting that both vacuum cleaners fail to clean the surfaces of carpet effectively, considering that wipe sampling media simulate surface contact. On upholstery, the wipe sampling data showed a significant reduction in lead loading for the non-HEPA vacuum cleaner (22.2%, p = 0.047). Even with the significant reduction, the postcleaning lead loadings on upholstery were similar to those on carpets. The similar lead loading results for carpets and upholstery indicate that soiled upholstery may be as important a source of childhood lead exposure as carpets.","2002","New Jersey","None","air"
"Evaluation of a childhood lead questionnaire in predicting elevated blood lead levels in a rural community","The accuracy of a lead screening questionnaire in predicting elevated blood lead levels was examined in a pediatric practice in a rural part of New York state. A retrospective chart review was used to collect data on children ages 9 to 24 months who presented for well-child visits. Children with both questionnaire and lead level results available in the chart were included in the study (n = 171). The mean blood lead level among all children was 1.6 microg/dl (median = 2.0 microg/dl, range 0 to 24 microg/dl). Four children (2.3%) had elevated lead levels (greater than 10 microg/dl), with levels for two of these children being greater than 20 microg/dl. Although our lead screening questionnaire was expanded from the standard 1991 CDC questionnaire by the inclusion of six additional items, it was not especially useful in predicting elevated blood lead levels above 10 microg/dl. However, the questionnaire exhibited some utility in predicting marked elevations in blood lead levels (over 20 microg/dl). Although results in other geographic areas might differ, the lead questionnaire may have value by enhancing parents' awareness of potential lead hazards in their children's environment and may prove to be more useful in areas of high risk to lead exposure.","2003","New York","None","None"
"Maternal blood lead concentration, diet during pregnancy, and anthropometry predict neonatal blood lead in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population","To determine the influences of maternal diet and nutrition during pregnancy on the blood lead level of neonates, we conducted a study of mother-infant pairs from lower socioeconomic circumstances living in Albany County, New York. Maternal blood lead (MBPb), anthropometry, and diet were assessed in each trimester. Neonates' blood lead (NBPb) levels were low (geometric mean = 1.58 micro g/dL), and none had elevated blood lead. More than 50% of the mothers had intakes below the recommended dietary allowances for zinc, calcium, iron, vitamin D, and kilocalories. As expected, MBPb was strongly and positively related to NBPb. Among the anthropometric measures of maternal nutritional status, variables measuring gain in weight and arm circumference were negatively related to NBPb. In multivariable models reflecting different analytic strageties and including MBPb, anthropometry, and sociodemographic characteristics, dietary intakes of iron and vitamin D were negatively related to NBPb. The effect of zinc varied substantially depending on model covariates. Effects of dietary constituents are difficult to distinguish, given the intercorrelated nature of nutrients in the diet. Nevertheless, the influences of maternal anthropometric variables, iron, and vitamin D on neonatal lead levels are clear in our analyses.","2003","New York","None","None"
"Assessing remedial effectiveness through the blood lead:soil/dust lead relationship at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in the Silver Valley of Idaho","The 21 square mile Bunker Hill Superfund Site in northern Idaho includes several thousand acres of contaminated hillsides and floodplain, a 365-acre abandoned lead/zinc smelter and is home to more than 7000 people in 5 residential communities. Childhood lead poisoning was epidemic in the 1970s with >75% of children exceeding 40 microg/dl blood lead. Health response activities have been ongoing for three decades. In 1991, a blood lead goal of 95% of children with levels less than 10 microg/dl was adopted. The cleanup strategy, based on biokinetic pathways models, was to reduce house dust lead exposure through elimination of soil-borne sources. An interim health intervention program, that included monitoring blood lead and exposures levels, was instituted to reduce exposures through parental education during the cleanup. In 1989 and 2001, 56% and 3% of children, respectively, exceeded the blood lead criteria. More than 4000 paired blood lead/environmental exposure observations were collected during this period. Several analyses of these data were accomplished. Slope factors derived for the relationship between blood lead, soil and dust concentrations are age-dependent and similar to literature reported values. Repeat measures analysis assessing year to year changes found that the remediation effort (without intervention) had approximately a 7.5 microg/dl effect in reducing a 2-year-old child's mean blood lead level over the course of the last ten years. Those receiving intervention had an additional 2-15 microg/dl decrease. Structural equations models indicate that from 40 to 50% of the blood lead absorbed from soils and dusts is through house dust with approximately 30% directly from community-wide soils and 30% from the home yard and immediate neighborhood. Both mean blood lead levels and percent of children to exceed 10 microg/dl have paralleled soil/dust lead intake rates estimated from the pathways model. Application of the IEUBK model for lead indicates that recommended USEPA default parameters overestimate mean blood lead levels, although the magnitude of over-prediction is diminished in recent years. Application of the site-specific model, using the soil and dust partitions suggested in the pathways model and an effective bioavailability of 18%, accurately predicts mean blood lead levels and percent of children to exceed 10 microg/dl throughout the 11-year cleanup period. This reduced response rate application of the IEUBK is consistent with the analysis used to originally develop the cleanup criteria and indicates the blood lead goal will be achieved.","2003","Idaho","soil","soil"
"Choosing area based socioeconomic measures to monitor social inequalities in low birth weight and childhood lead poisoning: The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project (US)","STUDY OBJECTIVES: : To determine which area based socioeconomic measures can meaningfully be used, at which level of geography, to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in childhood health in the US. DESIGN: Cross sectional analysis of birth certificate and childhood lead poisoning registry data, geocoded and linked to diverse area based socioeconomic measures that were generated at three geographical levels: census tract, block group, and ZIP code. SETTING: Two US states: Massachusetts (1990 population=6,016,425) and Rhode Island (1990 population=1,003,464). PARTICIPANTS: All births born to mothers ages 15 to 55 years old who were residents of either Massachusetts (1989-1991; n=267,311) or Rhode Island (1987-1993; n=96 138), and all children ages 1 to 5 years residing in Rhode Island who were screened for lead levels between 1994 and 1996 (n=62,514 children, restricted to first test during the study period). MAIN RESULTS: Analyses of both the birth weight and lead data indicated that: (a) block group and tract socioeconomic measures performed similarly within and across both states, while ZIP code level measures tended to detect smaller effects; (b) measures pertaining to economic poverty detected stronger gradients than measures of education, occupation, and wealth; (c) results were similar for categories generated by quintiles and by a priori categorical cut off points; and (d) the area based socioeconomic measures yielded estimates of effect equal to or augmenting those detected, respectively, by individual level educational data for birth outcomes and by the area based housing measure recommended by the US government for monitoring childhood lead poisoning.

"Assessing lay health advisor activity in an intervention to prevent lead poisoning in Native American children","The purpose of this study is to assess patterns of lay health advisor (LHA) activity in an intervention to reduce lead exposure in Native American children exposed to mine waste. A total of 39 LHAs were recruited and trained to become LHAs from eight tribes in northeastern Oklahoma. LHAs completed activity tracking forms over a 2-year intervention period to document contacts made with community groups and individuals in their social networks. They engaged in an average of 5.4 activities per month, reaching an average of 39 persons. Close members of their social networks were reached in 40.4% of the contacts; persons outside of their networks were reached in 24% of the contacts. This study suggests that 1 to 3 contacts per week may be a reasonable expectation for LHA activity. Findings also suggest that LHA interventions are a promising approach for engaging Native American communities in addressing an environmental health problem.","2003","Oklahoma","None","None"

"Using geographic information systems to assess risk for elevated blood lead levels in children","Objectives. Targeted screening for childhood lead poisoning depends on assessment of risk factors including housing age. Using a geographic information system (GIS), we aim to determine high-risk regions in Charleston County, South Carolina, to assist public health officials in developing targeted leadscreening. Methods. Properties built before 1978 were geocoded (assigned latitude and longitude coordinates) from tax assessor data. Addresses of Charleston County children who have been screened for lead poisoning were also geocoded. Locations of all housing, lead poisoning cases, and negative screens were created as separate map layers. Prevalence ratios of lead poisoning cases were calculated, as were relative risks for each category of housing. Results. Maps of Charleston County were produced showing the location of old housing, where screening took place, and where cases were found. One thousand forty-four cases were identified. Twenty percent of children living in pre-1950 homes had elevated blood lead levels (EBLL). Children living in pre-1950 housing were 3.9 times more likely to have an EBLL than children living in post-1977 housing. There was no difference in risk of living in a 1950-1977 home vs. a post-1977 home. A large number of cases were also found in an area of newer houses, but near a potential point source. Eighty-two percent of all screens were from children in post-1977 homes. Conclusions. Children living in pre-1950 housing were at higher risk for lead poisoning. GIS is useful in identifying areas of risk and unexpected clustering from potential point sources and may be useful for public health officials in developing targeted screening programs.","2003","South Carolina","None","None"
"The association of lead-contaminated house dust and blood lead levels of children living on a former landfill in Puerto Rico","Exposure to lead in children living on a former landfill in Vega Baja-Puerto Rico, a United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) designated Superfund Site, is a major health concern. Direct contact with lead-contaminated soil is considered a major exposure source. However, there is a lack of information regarding the contribution of lead-contaminated house dust to children's blood lead concentrations. This study evaluated the relationship between lead contaminated-house dust and children's blood lead levels. Blood from 42 children, aged 6 years old or less, and dust from 29 houses were analyzed for lead, and face-to-face interviews were performed to gather information on potential risk factors for high blood lead levels. Blood lead levels ranged from 0.97 to 7.79 micrograms/dL. Lead values for floors fluctuated from 0.12 to 98.30 micrograms/ft2, with 17% of houses surpassing the USEPA standard of 40 micrograms/ft2. Multiple regression analysis showed that lead in window sills, toy chewing and soil eating habits were significant predictors of blood lead levels. Further investigations aimed at assessing the long-term effects of constant exposure to environmental lead in these children are warranted.","2003","Puerto Rico","None","soil"
"Impact of home carpets on childhood lead intervention study","Blood lead data for a childhood lead exposure study have been reanalyzed to examine the impact of carpets on the effectiveness of a cleaning intervention in 39 New Jersey urban houses. All eligible houses in the study were classified as carpeted and uncarpeted depending on the number of rooms that were carpeted. The cleaning protocol was associated with a significant reduction in the blood lead concentrations for the uncarpeted homes (P = 0.004), whereas no significant change was found for the carpeted homes (P = 0.566). We also completed correlation analyses between the number of cleaning visits and the percentage reduction in blood lead for the carpeted/uncarpeted houses. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.67) between the number of cleanings and blood lead reduction for the uncarpeted homes, but no correlation (r = 0.04) for the carpeted homes. In a multiple regression model that took confounding variables into account, the carpet status (carpeted or uncarpeted) remained a factor of the effect of cleaning on blood lead (P = 0.05). We conclude that the presence of contaminated carpets inhibits the effectiveness of home cleaning despite a high-efficiency particulate air filtered vacuum protocol that removes a substantial amount of lead dust.","2003","New Jersey","None","air"
"Field evaluation and comparison of five methods of sampling lead dust on carpets","Five methods of sampling lead-contaminated dust on carpets were evaluated and compared in 33 New Jersey homes of children with elevated blood lead levels. The five sampling methods were (1) wipe, (2) adhesive label, (3) C18 sheet, (4) vacuum, and (5) hand rinse. Samples were collected side by side on the same carpets within the homes. Among the five methods the wipe and vacuum methods showed high percentages of detectable samples, good reproducibility, and significant correlations with other methods. C18 sheets and adhesive labels collected the least quantity of lead dust, with high percentages of undetectable samples. Because of the limited ability of sampling lead on carpets and the relatively high cost for laboratory analysis, C18 sheets or adhesive labels are not considered feasible sampling techniques. The hand rinse method also was not feasible for carpet sampling, because it was difficult to conduct in the field and laboratory, and it was subject to inconsistency and cross contamination. Wipes, which collected lead dust from carpet surfaces, were believed to be the most appropriate method for measuring lead from carpets accessible to children. However, because of the low pickup from carpets, wipes may not be an appropriate measuring tool to assess the levels of total lead contamination in carpets. The authors recommend using surface wipe sampling to measure accessible lead from carpets for exposure assessment, and vacuum sampling to obtain the information on total lead accumulation.

"Changing trends in the epidemiology of pediatric lead exposure: interrelationship of blood lead and ZPP concentrations and a comparison to the US population","OBJECTIVES: To determine blood lead and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) concentrations in a pediatric population, confirm their interrelationship at low blood lead concentrations, and assess changing trends through comparison of these data with those found in a similar population 10 years earlier and to US national values. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a large pediatric hospital in the Washington DC area (CNMC) on patient whole blood specimens (n = 4908) (0-17 years) accrued from January 2001 to June 2002. Pediatric blood lead concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and ZPP by hematofluorometry. The data were analyzed using a computer adaptation of the Hoffmann approach. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Blood lead level (BLL) means ranged between 2.2 and 3.3 micro g/dL, and the median BLL was 3 micro g/dL throughout. Mean ZPP concentrations ranged between 21.1 and 26.6 micro g/dL and the median concentrations between 21 and 27 micro g/dL. In comparison to data obtained from a similar pediatric population at CNMC between 1991 and 1992, pediatric BLLs have significantly declined in the Washington DC area. The current data are also compared with data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) of the US population. The interrelationship between ZPP and BLLs is examined.","2003","Washington","None","social"
"Surveillance for elevated blood lead levels among children--United States, 1997-2001","PROBLEM/CONDITION: Lead is neurotoxic and particularly harmful to the developing nervous systems of fetuses and young children. Extremely high blood lead levels (BLLs) (i.e.,> or =70 microg/dL) can cause severe neurologic problems (e.g., seizure, coma, and death). However, no threshold has been determined regarding lead's harmful effects on children's learning and behavior. In 1990, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established a national goal to eliminate BLLs >25 microg/dL by 2000; a new goal targets elimination of BLLs > or =10 microg/dL in children aged <6 years by 2010. REPORTING PERIOD: Information regarding children's BLLs comes from 1) National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted during 1976-1980, 1988-1991, 1991-1994, and 1999-2000; and 2) state child blood lead surveillance data for test results collected during 1997-2001. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: CDC tracks children's BLLs in the United States by using both NHANES and state and local surveillance data. NHANES reports data regarding children aged 1-5 years; state and local surveillance systems report data regarding children aged <72 months. Because lead exposure in children varies among populations and communities, both surveys are needed to determine the burden of elevated BLLs among young children throughout the United States. NHANES uses highly standardized data-collection procedures and probability samples to gather information regarding the health and nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. State and local childhood lead surveillance systems are based on reports of blood lead tests from laboratories. State and local programs submit data to CDC annually. In this report, confirmed elevated BLLs are defined as one venous blood specimen > or =10 microg/dL or two capillary blood specimens > or =10 microg/dL drawn within 12 weeks of each other. RESULTS: The NHANES 1999-2000 survey estimated that 434,000 children (95% confidence interval = 189,000-846,000) or 2.2% of children aged 1-5 years had BLLs > or =10 microg/dL. For 2001, a total of 44 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC) submitted child blood lead surveillance data to CDC. These jurisdictions represent 95% of the U.S. population of children aged <72 months and 97% of the nation's pre-1950 housing. The number of children tested and reported to CDC increased from 1,703,356 in 1997 (37 states, DC, and NYC reporting), to 2,422,298 in 2001 (44 states, DC, and NYC reporting). During that time, the number of children reported with confirmed elevated BLLs > or =10 microg/dL steadily decreased from 130,512 in 1997 to 74,887 in 2001. In 2000, the year targeted for national elimination of BLLs >25 microg/dL, a total of 8,723 children had BLLs > or =25 microg/dL. INTERPRETATION: Both national surveys and state surveillance data indicate children's BLLs continue to decline throughout the United States. However, thousands of children continue to be identified with elevated BLLs. The 2000 goal of eliminating BLLs >25 microg/dL was not met. Attaining the 2010 goal of eliminating BLLs > or =10 microg/dL will require intensified efforts to target areas at highest risk, evaluate preventive measures, and improve the quality of surveillance data. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: States will continue to use surveillance data to 1) promote legislation supporting lead poisoning prevention activities, 2) obtain funding, 3) identify risk groups, 4) target and evaluate prevention activities, and 5) monitor and describe progress toward elimination of BLLs > or =10 microg/dL. CDC will work with state and local programs to improve tracking systems and the collection, timeliness, and quality of surveillance data.","2003","District of Columbia","None","None"
"Residential arsenic and lead levels in an agricultural community with a history of lead arsenate use","Lead arsenate (PbHAsO4) was used as an insecticide in Washington fruit orchards from 1905 to 1947. We examined exposure potential for children living in an agricultural community with historic PbHAsO4 use. Soil and housedust samples were collected from 58 residences. Families were asked about land use history, age of home, and remodeling activities. Median concentrations of arsenic were higher in housedust than in soil (9.0 and 4.2 mug/g, respectively; P = 0.05), as were lead concentrations (129 and 46 mug/g, respectively; P = 0.0001). Significant associations were observed between indoor and outdoor levels of each metal, indicating track-in as an important exposure pathway. Homes on or near land use for pear or apple production between 1905 and 1947 had significantly higher soil (P = 0.005) and housedust (P = 0.004) lead, and soil arsenic (P = 0.04) than did the other homes. Homes more than 30 years old had significantly higher soil and housedust lead than did newer homes (P = 0.01). Homes remodeled within the past two years had significantly higher soil (P = 0.01) and housedust (P = 0.04) lead. Child doses extrapolated from these data indicate that 36% of homes had soil or dust arsenic levels above the minimum risk level estimated by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. None of the measured lead levels exceeded current US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. Public health education programs focused on residential hygiene would be of value in areas of historic PbHAsO4 use. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

"Effect of a follow-up professional home cleaning on serial dust and blood lead levels of urban children","Children residing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who were enrolled in a clinical trial of oral chelation therapy (n=73) were studied to determine the effects of a follow-up professional lead dust cleaning of their homes 18 mo after an initial cleaning and commencement of therapy. Home dust lead levels were determined from dust-wipe specimens collected from the kitchen and playroom floors, and from a playroom windowsill, prior to, immediately following, and 3 and 6 mo after the second cleaning. Children's blood lead levels were assessed at 3-mo intervals before and after the follow-up cleaning. Professional cleaning produced immediate decreases in dust lead levels; however, dust lead re-accumulated to precleaning levels within 3-6 mo. Frequent, repeated cleanings may be required if blood lead or dust lead levels are to be reduced and sustained at low levels in urban homes.","2003","Pennsylvania","None","None"
"A survey of compliance: Medicaid's mandated blood lead screenings for children age 12-18 months in Nebraska","BACKGROUND: To determine the frequency of Medicaid mandated blood lead level (BLL) screening compliance rates by clinical site.

"Lead distribution in near-surface soils of two Florida cities: Gainesville and Miami","Knowledge of the distribution of soil lead (Pb) is useful for making sound environmental decisions. The objective of this study was to determine soil Pb distribution in two Florida urban areas of similar size with different levels of industrial development and population: Gainesville and Miami. About 200 and 240 soil samples were collected within a depth of 0.2 and 0.1 m in Gainesville and Miami, respectively. These samples, from three land-use classes (residential, commercial and public land), were digested using USEPA method 3051a and analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GFAAS). Soil Pb concentrations varied greatly in both cities, with geometric mean (GM) values of similar to16 and similar to93 mg kg(-1) in Gainesville and Miami, respectively. Both the median (15 mg kg(-1)) and the 95th percentile concentrations (10 1 mg; kg(-1)) of the whole dataset in Gainesville were below the Florida soil clean-up target level (SCTL, 500 mg kg(-1)) for residential areas. Although the corresponding values (median and 95th percentile) for Miami were significantly higher, they were also both below the Florida residential SCTL for Pb (98 and 453 mg kg(-1), respectively). Residential and commercial areas in both cities showed higher Pb concentrations than public parks. Results from this study can be used as a rough guide on how Pb is distributed in Gainesville and Miami. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2004","Florida","None","soil"
"An innovative blood lead screening program for Indian children","There is little information on the lead levels of Indian children nationally. In the late 1990s, members of the Chippewa and Cree tribes living on the Rocky Boy Reservation near Box Elder, Montana, were concerned about environmental pollution and how it might be affecting the health of their children. With financial assistance from the Environmental Protection Agency, the tribes designed and implemented an innovative lead screening program for young children. Because most children on the reservation participated in WIC and Head Start, those programs were used to indentify and screen close to 100% of young children on the reservation. The average blood lead level for children ages 1-5 on the Rocky Boy reservation was 2.4mug/dL, which is not significantly different from that of children of the same age nationally. The project showed that Indian families will participate readily in screening programs that may improve their children's health.","2004","Montana","None","None"
"Effectiveness of cleaning and health education in reducing childhood lead poisoning among children residing near superfund sites in Missouri","In this study, the authors evaluated whether a combination of tailored education, lead dust removal by trained cleaning specialists, and family follow-up visits would be more effective than conventional health educational programs in reducing elevated blood lead levels in children living in or near lead mining hazardous waste sites. The authors randomized children between 6 and 72 mo of age with blood lead levels between 10 and 20 microg/dl into 3 groups: standard care, tailored newsletters, or tailored newsletters and specialized cleaning. The authors obtained questionnaires, blood lead levels, and environmental lead samples during initiation and compared them with the same items obtained at 3, 6, and 9 mo follow-up. They used a linear mixed effect model to evaluate the intervention effect. Blood lead levels decreased overall 1.54 microg/dl (12.1%) during the study. The authors found that tailored newsletters and specialized cleaning produced the greatest decline in blood lead levels, but no statistical differences were found among the methodologies. The small decline observed in blood lead levels reduced levels to below 10 microg/dl for 40% of the children.","2004","Missouri","None","social"
"Blood lead levels in residents of homes with elevated lead in tap water--District of Columbia, 2004","Lead exposure adversely affects intellectual development in young children and might increase the risk for hypertension in adults. In the District of Columbia (DC), of an estimated 130,000 residences, approximately 23,000 (18%) have lead service pipes (Daniel Lucey, MD, DC Department of Health [DCDOH], personal communication, March 24, 2004). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires water authorities to test tap water in 10-100 residences annually for lead. In March 2003, DC Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) expanded its lead-in-water testing program to homes with lead service pipes extending from the water main to the house. By late January 2004, results of the expanded water testing indicated that the majority of homes tested had water lead levels above EPA's action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). On February 16, DCDOH requested CDC assistance to assess health effects of elevated lead levels in residential tap water. DCDOH also requested deployment of officers of the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) to assist in the investigations. This report summarizes the results of the preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated water lead levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (BLLs). The investigation of elevated water lead levels is ongoing. In the interim, DCDOH has recommended that young children and pregnant and breast-feeding women refrain from drinking unfiltered tap water.","2004","District of Columbia","water","water"
"Change in blood lead concentration up to 1 year after a gunshot wound with a retained bullet","The authors studied the time course and prevalence of elevated blood lead concentrations and associated injury- and patient-specific factors during the first year following gunshot injury. They determined blood lead levels at mean time points of 0.3, 3.1, 18.7, 94.5, 188.3, and 349.4 days after injury in a volunteer sample of 451 subjects from a Los Angeles, California, trauma center who sustained a first-time gunshot injury with a retained projectile in 2000-2002. In mixed-model analyses, blood lead levels increased with time postinjury (p < 0.0005) up to 3 months, with number of retained fragments (p < 0.0005), and with increasing age (p < 0.0005). Increased blood lead concentration as a function of fragmentation was approximately 30% higher among subjects who had suffered bone fracture in the torso (p < 0.0005). Subjects with bullets or fragments lodged near bone (p < 0.0005) or near joints (p = 0.032) had higher blood lead levels. Logistic models correctly predicted a blood lead elevation of >/=20 micro g/dl in 81% and 85% of subjects at 3 and 6 months postinjury, respectively.

"Update on research findings and regulatory/legal activities regarding tapwater lead exposure from traditional leaded-brass and ""No-Lead"" type pluming parts","Although an increasing number of North American cities including Los Angeles, Detroit, Tampa, Hamilton, ONT, and Bangor, Maine have switched or are switching to ""No-Lead"" brass water service parts and meters, the majority of public water suppliers are still using traditional 5 percent or 7 percent leaded-brass parts in their residential services. Recent medical studies with young children combined with carefully-controlled laboratory lead discharge studies indicate that the amount of lead discharged to household plumbing systems from these parts is sufficient to cause significant neurologic damage (0.5 to 2.5 IQ points) to infants and young children in these residences, depending on water consumption habits and water corrosivity. From public health and possible legal considerations, it is probably wise and prudent for New England public water suppliers to begin specifying only ""No-Lead"" type water service parts and meters, which are now readily available from several manufacturers.","2004","Maine","water","water"
"Trends in blood lead levels among children enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children from 1996 to 2000","We analyzed data from the Wisconsin Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to examine the distribution of and trends in elevated blood lead levels among WIC-enrolled children from 1996 until 2000. Higher blood lead levels were seen among WIC-enrolled children, and although not statistically significant, the rate of blood lead level decline among WIC-enrolled children was greater than among non-WIC-enrolled children.","2004","Wisconsin","None","None"
"Geographic analysis of blood lead levels in New York State children born 1994-1997","We examined the geographic distribution of the blood lead levels (BLLs) of 677,112 children born between 1994 and 1997 in New York State and screened before 2 years of age. Five percent of the children screened had BLLs higher than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention action level of 10 microg/dL. Rates were higher in upstate cities than in the New York City area. We modeled the relationship between BLLs and housing and socioeconomic characteristics at the ZIP code level. Older housing stock, a lower proportion of high school graduates, and a higher percentage of births to African-American mothers were the community characteristics most associated with elevated BLLs. Although the prevalence of children with elevated BLLs declined 44% between those born in 1994 and those born in 1997, the rate of improvement may be slowing down. Lead remains an environmental health problem in inner-city neighborhoods, particularly in upstate New York. We identified areas having a high prevalence of children with elevated BLLs. These communities can be targeted for educational and remediation programs. The model locates areas with a higher or lower prevalence of elevated BLLs than expected. These communities can be studied further at the individual level to better characterize the factors that contribute to these differences.","2004","New York","None","social"
"PAHs and metals in the soils of inner-city and suburban New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","Representative soil samples of an inner-city and suburban community (n = 19 each) are evaluated for 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[j]fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[g,h,i]perylene) and nine metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co and V). Surface (2.5 cm deep) samples were air-dried and sieved (2mm USGS #10). Accelerated solvent extraction was used for PAH preparation prior to analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metals were extracted at a 5:1 ratio of I mol nitric acid to soil, shaken at room temperature, centrifuged, filtered and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Total PAHs (median 2927 ng g(-1) versus 731 ng g(-1)) and the total metals (median 1323 mug g(-1) versus 183 mug g(-1)) summarize differences (P < 0.0001) between the inner-city and suburb, respectively. A strong association exists between PAHs and metals for all 38 soil samples (correlation coefficient = 0.831, P < 0.00001). In terms of the specific sites of accumulation, both PAHs and metals show the same pattern: busy streets > foundations > residential streets > open areas. This study provides real-world data about various chemical mixtures which may be a factor of possible health disparities in sensitive populations, especially children, in different communities of New Orleans.

"Improving strategies to prevent childhood lead poisoning using local data","Lead poisoning remains an important, yet entirely preventable, disease among children worldwide. Children's blood lead levels (BLLs) have been declining in the United States; however, nearly half a million children have BLLs >= 10 mu g/dl, the level targeted for elimination by 2010. Attainment of this national goal will require translating knowledge into public health practice. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds state and local health departments to develop comprehensive prevention programs and surveillance. The Jefferson County, Kentucky Program, which includes Louisville, adopted CDC's recommendation for targeting lead testing to children at highest risk and used knowledge of risk factors for lead poisoning to develop prevention strategies. Blood lead testing was targeted to Louisville neighborhoods at high risk, i.e., those characterized by housing built before 1950 and valued < $50,000, which are known risk factors for BLLs >= 10 mu g/dl among children. We evaluated the impact of these and other interventions. Testing of children aged 9-24 months who were born in high risk housing increased from 64.5% to 73.7% (p-value < 0.001) among the 1996 and 2000 birth cohorts. Among the 1996 and 2000 birth cohorts, there was no significant change in testing of children born in low risk housing, i.e., built after 1950 and valued at >= $50,000 (37.0-37.5%; p-value = 0.649). This report demonstrates that applying scientific knowledge to public health practice and using surveillance and other data to evaluate practice effectively increased testing of children at high risk for lead poisoning, increased lead-safe housing, and empowered communities to protect their children from lead exposure.

"Childhood lead poisoning in Washington state: A statewide survey","Although childhood lead poisoning is an important health issue in the United States, it is not distributed evenly across the country. To estimate the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning in Washington State, the authors conducted a birth certificate follow-back survey of 1- to 2-year-old children. Interviewers visited participating families at their homes to conduct blood lead tests with a portable testing device. The estimated prevalence of lead poisoning for all 1- to 2-year-old children in the state was 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-2.7); for Hispanic children in central Washington, it was 3.7% (95% CI: 1.3-10.2), and their risk of lead poisoning was significantly higher than that of all other children in the state (relative risk [RR] = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.3-24.9). Lead poisoning prevalence in Washington State children is lower than the US average and is highest among Hispanic children in central Washington.","2005","Washington","None","None"
"Biosolids compost amendment for reducing soil lead hazards: a pilot study of Orgro (R) amendment and grass seeding in urban yards","In situ inactivation of soil Pb is an alternative to soil removal and replacement that has been demonstrated in recent years at industrial sites with hazardous soil Pb concentrations. Most children exposed to elevated soil Pb, however, reside in urban areas, and no government programs exist to remediate such soils unless an industrial source caused the contamination. Modern regulated biosolids composts have low Pb concentrations and low bioaccessible Pb fractions and can improve grass growth on urban soils. High Fe and P biosolids composts can reduce the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of soil Pb and can aid in establishing vegetation that would reduce soil transfer into homes. For these reasons, we conducted a field test of their use to reduce Pb bioaccessibility in urban soils in Baltimore, MD USA. We chose biosolids compost for its expected reduction in the bioaccessible Pb fraction of urban soils, ease of use by urban residents, and ability to beautify urban areas. Nine urban yards with mean soil Pb concentrations > 800 mg Pb kg(-1) were selected and sampled at: several distances from the house foundation before soil treatment. The soils were rototilled to 20 cm depth to prepare the sites, and resampled. The yards were then amended with 6-8 cm depth of Orgro (R) biosolids compost (110-180 dry t/ha) rich in Fe and P, mixed well by rototilling, and resampled. Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) was seeded and became well established. Soils were resampled 1 year later. At each sampling time, total soil Pb was measured using a modified U.S. EPA nitric acid hotplate digestion method (SW 846 Method 3050) and bioaccessible Pb fraction was measured using the Solubility/Bioaccesibility Research Consortium standard operating procedure with modifications, including the use of glycine-buffered HCl at pH 2.2.. Samples of untreated soils were collected from each yard and mixed well to serve as controls for the Pb bioaccessibility of field treated soils over time independent of positional variance within yards. At 1-year post-treatment, grass cover was healthy and reductions in bioaccessible Pb concentrations compared to pre-tillage were 64% (from 1655 to 595 mg kg(-1)) and 67% (from 1381 to 453 mg kg(-1)) at the sampling lines closest to the houses. Little or no reduction in bioaccessible Pb concentration was observed at sampling lines more remote from the house that also had the lowest bioaccessible Pb concentrations at pre-tillage (620 and 436 mg kg(-1), respectively). For the control soils, changes over time in total Pb and bioaccessible Pb concentrations and the bioaccessible Pb fraction were insignificant. This study confirms the viability of in situ remediation of soils in urban areas where children are at risk of high Pb exposure from lead in paint, dust and soil. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Using surveillance data to develop and disseminate local childhood lead poisoning screening recommendations: Miami-Dade County's experience","Before 1999, few children in Florida's Miami-Dade County were being screened for lead poisoning. To improve screening rates, the county's department of health developed screening recommendations and a screening tool using surveillance and census data and disseminated these materials to primary care providers. Each year, recommendations have been reviewed to assess their sensitivity, and revised recommendations have been disseminated to health care providers. The percentage of children 6 years or younger screened in Florida who reside in Miami-Dade County increased from 4.1% in 1998 to 20.3% in 2002. Analysis and dissemination of blood lead surveillance data not only guide development of screening recommendations but also educate health care providers regarding the importance of childhood screening.","2005","Florida","None","None"
"Lead exposure from indoor firing ranges among students on shooting teams--Alaska, 2002-2004","CDC recognizes blood lead levels (BLLs) of >/=25 microg/dL in adults and >/=10 microg/dL in children aged </=6 years as levels of concern; no similar level has been set for older children and adolescents. During 2002-2004, the Alaska Environmental Public Health Program (EPHP) conducted lead-exposure assessments of school-based indoor shooting teams in the state, after a BLL of 44 microg/dL was reported in a man aged 62 years who coached a high school shooting team in central Alaska. This report summarizes the results of the EPHP investigation of potential lead exposure in 66 members of shooting teams, aged 7-19 years, who used five indoor firing ranges. The findings suggest that improper design, operation, and maintenance of ranges were the likely cause of elevated BLLs among team members at four of the five firing ranges. Public health officials should identify indoor firing ranges that have not implemented lead-safety measures and offer consultation to reduce the risk for lead exposure among shooters, coaches, and employees.","2005","Alaska","None","None"
"Prevalence and predictors of residential health hazards: A pilot study","This article reports the results of a pilot study designed to ascertain the prevalence of lead-based paint (LBP), vermin, mold, and safety conditions and hazards and to validate observations and self-reports against environmental sampling data. Data are based on a convenience sample of 70 dwellings in a low-income, urban neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The vast majority of residences (96%) contained multiple conditions and/or hazards: LBP hazards (80%), vermin (79%), elevated levels of airborne mold (39%), and safety hazards (100%). Observations and occupant reports were associated with environmental sampling data. In general, the more proximate an observed condition was to an actual hazard, the more likely it was to be associated with environmental sampling results (e.g.. peeling LBP was associated with windowsill dust lead levels, and cockroach sightings by tenants were associated with Blatella germanica [Bla g 1] levels). Conversely, the more distal an observed condition was to an actual hazard, the less likely it was to be associated with environmental sampling results (e.g., water damage, alone, was not statistically v associated with elevated levels of dust lead, Bla g 1, or airborne mold). Based on the findings from this pilot study, there is a need for industrial hygienists and others to adopt more comprehensive and integrative approaches to residential hazard assessment and remediation. Further research-using larger, randomly drawn samples, representing a range of housing types and geographical areas-is needed to clarify the relationship between readily observable conditions, occupant reports, and environmental sampling data and to assess the cumulative impact on human health.","2005","New York","None","None"
"Seasonality and children's blood lead levels: developing a predictive model using climatic variables and blood lead data from Indianapolis, Indiana, Syracuse, New York, and New Orleans, Louisiana (USA)","On a community basis, urban soil contains a potentially large reservoir of accumulated lead. This study was undertaken to explore the temporal relationship between pediatric blood lead (BPb), weather, soil moisture, and dust in Indianapolis, Indiana; Syracuse, New York; and New Orleans, Louisiana.

These average monthly child BPb levels were regressed against several independent variables: average monthly soil moisture, particulate matter < 10 microm in diameter (PM10), wind speed, and temperature. Of temporal variation in urban children's BPb, 87% in Indianapolis (R2 = 0.87, p = 0.0004), 61% in Syracuse (R2 = 0.61, p = 0.0012), and 59% in New Orleans (R2 = 0.59, p = 0.0000078) are explained by these variables. A conceptual model of urban Pb poisoning is suggested: When temperature is high and evapotranspiration maximized, soil moisture decreases and soil dust is deposited. Under these combined weather conditions, Pb-enriched PM10 dust disperses in the urban environment and causes elevated Pb dust loading. Thus, seasonal variation of children's Pb exposure is probably caused by inhalation and ingestion of Pb brought about by the effect of weather on soils and the resulting fluctuation in Pb loading.","2005","Indiana","None","social"

"Understanding childhood lead poisoning preventive behaviors: the roles of self-efficacy, subjective norms, and perceived benefits","Introduction-Understanding individual and social influences on behaviors commonly recommended to prevent lead poisoning in children can guide more effective educational interventions. Methods. In-person interviews were conducted with primary caregivers (n = 380) of American Indian and White children aged I to 6 living in or near the Tar Creek Superfund site in northeastern Oklahoma. Caregivers' perceived health benefits, self-efficacy, and subjective norms were assessed for four lead poisoning prevention behaviors (i.e., annual blood lead testing, playing in safe areas, washing hands before eating, and dusting with a damp cloth). Results. Caregivers spoke with their own mothers, spouses, and other female family members most often when they had concerns or worries about taking care of their children. In multivariate models, subjective norms, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy were positively associated with the hand-washing and damp-dusting behaviors, while only self-efficacy was associated with playing in safe areas. None of the variables were found to have significant influence on the blood lead testing behavior. Conclusions. Education programs should address individual level factors such as self-efficacy and perceived health benefits but also consider new strategies that incorporate a non-native dimension to lead poisoning prevention.

"Blood lead testing among medicaid-enrolled children in Michigan","Background: Federal regulations mandate that Medicaid-enrolled children be tested for lead poisoning at the age of 1 and 2 years or 3 through 5 years if not previously tested. Objectives: To measure the rate of blood lead testing among Medicaid-enrolled children in Michigan and the subsequent proportion of children with elevated lead levels and to determine factors associated with testing and elevated lead levels. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of children aged 5 years or younger continuously enrolled in Michigan Medicaid during 2002. Results: There were 216 578 children included in the analysis. The overall rate of blood lead testing was 19.6% (9590 confidence interval [CI], 19.4-19.8) of which 8.3% (95% Cl, 8.0-8.5) had a level of 10 mu g/dL [0.48 mu mol/L] or higher. Hispanic or nonwhite children or those living in high-risk areas for lead exposure were more likely to be tested and more likely to have an elevated blood lead level. However, 1.2% of tested children without these additional risk factors had a level of 10 mu g/dL higher. Enrollment in Medicaid managed care was associated with an increased likelihood of blood lead testing. After adjusting for other factors, those in managed care for 75% or more of their enrollment in 2002 had 1.98 (95% CI, 1.46-2.68) greater odds of being tested than those in fee-for-service for 75%, or more of their enrollment. Conclusions: The rate of blood lead testing; was low. Patterns suggest testing was targeted to those at highest risk, potentially leading some children with elevated blood lead levels to be missed.","2005","Michigan","None","None"
"Childhood lead poisoning in 2 families associated with spices used in food preparation","Although most cases of childhood lead poisoning are caused by contaminated paint and dust in older homes, a variety of unusual sources of lead exposure are occasionally found. We report here 2 families whose children were poisoned by lead-contaminated spices that were purchased in foreign countries, brought to the United States, and then used in the preparation of the family's food. Six children (2-17 years old) in a family from the Republic of Georgia were poisoned by swanuri marili (lead content: 100 and 2040 mg/kg in separately sampled products) and kharchos suneli (zafron) lead content: 23 100 mg/kg) purchased from a street vendor in Tbilisi, Georgia. The second family had purchased a mixture of spices called kozhambu (lead content: 310 mg/kg) while traveling in India. Both the parents and their 2-year-old child subsequently suffered lead poisoning. The young children in both families required short-term chelation to bring their blood lead levels down to a safer range. Clinicians should be vigilant for all sources of lead contamination, including spices, when whole families are found to have elevated blood lead levels despite a confirmed lead-safe home environment. Families traveling abroad should be aware of the potential health risks associated with the purchase and use of spices that have not been tested for purity.","2005","Georgia","None","social"
"Prevalence of elevated blood lead levels and evaluation of a lead-risk-screening questionnaire in rural Minnesota","The objectives of the study reported here were to determine the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in rural Minnesota and to evaluate a lead-risk-screening questionnaire. Blood lead tests and lead risk questionnaires were obtained for a sample of 1,090 children younger than 48 months of age (72 percent of the eligible population) from three rural counties of west-central Minnesota between September 1, 2001, and August 31, 2002. It was found that overall, 2.4 percent of children in the study had blood lead levels of > or = 10 microg/dL (0.48 micromol/L) (results for capillary and venous tests combined), 0.9 percent had venous blood lead levels of > or = 10 microg/dL, and 0.5 percent of study participants had blood lead levels of > or = 20 microg/dL (0.96 micromol/L). Three risk factor questions, when taken together, predicted 90 percent of blood lead levels of > or = 10 microg/dL and all blood lead levels of > or = 20 microg/dL. The study estimated the prevalence of lead poisoning using a sample of the entire population rather than a clinic-based convenience sample.

"Evaluation of lead hazard control treatments in four Massachusetts communities through analysis of blood-lead surveillance data","This study utilized existing blood-lead surveillance data and records of housing properties treated for lead hazard control (LHC) in order to investigate the effectiveness of LHC treatments performed in four Massachusetts communities (Boston, Cambridge, Malden, and Springfield). This research is part of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) overall program evaluation strategy for assessing the effectiveness of their LHC Grant Program. Childhood blood-lead levels (BLLs) in housing units that were treated through HUD's LHC Grant Program were compared to BLLs in untreated matched control housing units. Data from multiple sources-local housing departments, local tax assessor departments, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health-were linked to identify similar sets of treated and untreated dwellings. Geometric mean BLLs from before and after treatment were compared for the two sets of housing. Ten years of blood-lead surveillance data for children living in the selected dwellings were analyzed using log-linear mixed models and logistic regression models. Results indicate a 50% decline in BLLs in treated homes, a significantly larger decline than in untreated homes after adjusting for the general downward trend in BLLs observed in the general population for the last several years. Data show that homes that received HUD LHC treatments had children with blood-lead levels that declined twice as fast as in similar untreated homes. These findings show that LHC efforts are successful in reducing children's blood-lead levels.","2005","Massachusetts","None","social"
"Lessons from a primary-prevention program for lead poisoning among inner-city children","This study evaluated the impact on childhood lead poisoning of a primary-prevention educational-intervention program for pregnant women in St. Louis, Missouri. The women were predominantly poor and of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Caucasian backgrounds. The interventions, tailored for each woman on the basis of responses to a survey and environmental measurements, included case management with hands-on instruction on cleaning techniques, property maintenance, hygiene, and nutrition to reduce exposure of newborns to lead. It was hypothesized that the probability of lead poisoning (blood lead levels greater than 10 microg/dL) would be reduced among mothers who received the interventions compared with those who received only printed educational material. Contrary to expectations, none of the interventions reduced the likelihood of lead poisoning among participating children. In the process of the study, however, a number of valuable lessons related to recruitment and commitment of participants emerged that can inform future efforts of this nature.","2005","Missouri","None","None"

Sample: Respondents (n = 532) were primarily female, white, with at least a high school education, and between the ages of 20-30 years. Measurements: Items from the Blood Lead Education and Screening Tool concerning parental receipt of lead-poisoning prevention information, persons with whom parents had discussed lead-poisoning prevention, parental receipt of a reminder about blood lead testing, and parents' preferred methods of obtaining lead-poisoning prevention information. Results: Most respondents had obtained lead-poisoning prevention information, but only 28% reported receiving a reminder to have their child's blood lead level assessed. Brochures and discussions with health care providers were the preferred methods of obtaining lead-poisoning prevention information. More minority respondents preferred receiving information via videos, billboards, and home visits. Younger parents preferred brochures, billboards, and speaking with someone at the health department or women, infants, and children supplemental nutrition (WIC). Most respondents identified multiple means by which they would like to receive lead-poisoning prevention information.

"Protein, phosphorus, and vitamin E intakes are associated with blood lead levels among WIC infants in rural West Virginia","The objectives were to document blood lead levels (BLLs) in a group of rural infants aged 5 to 26 months, measure the relationship between BILL and iron status, and identify nutrients associated with BLL. Dietary intake was measured using 2 multiple-pass 24-hour intakes of 57 infants who participated in the WIC program. The mean BLL was 30 +/- 16 mu g/L. Twelve infants, all older than 12 months, were iron-deficient. BLL was not different in those that were iron-deficient compared with iron-replete. Infants breastfed for 6 months or longer had higher (P < .05) BLL than infants breastfed for less than 6 months or not at all. At least part of their lead exposure came from mobilization of maternal stores. Intake of iron or calcium was not associated with BILL. Protein (P < .05) was positively associated and phosphorus (P < .05) and vitamin E (P < .05) were negatively associated with BLL. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"Trends in occupational and adult lead exposure in Wisconsin 1988 - 2005","Seventeen years of adult blood lead surveillance data (37,694 individuals and 71,622 total tests) reveal a Wisconsin success story. While lead continues to be widely used, most Wisconsin industries have made substantial strides toward reducing occupational lead exposure. The improvement is reflected in the reduced number of blood lead levels >40 microg/dL. In 2005 only a single adult blood lead test was >50 pg/dL, and since 2003 none have been reported above 60 microg/dL. However, as long as lead is used industrially, lead-based products remain in use, and new consumer products containing lead are marketed to the public, lead poisoning will remain a threat, not only to workers handling lead, but also to children exposed to lead-containing products already in existence. Wisconsin industry and workers, as well as the medical and public health community, must remain vigilant about new and reemerging lead exposures. Wisconsin's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program will continue to investigate unusual lead exposure circumstances identified through statutorily mandated physician and laboratory reporting of adult blood lead levels. However, Wisconsin will need further advances if it is to achieve the US Healthy People 2010 objective of no adult blood lead level >25 microg/dL.","2006","Wisconsin","None","None"
"Lead levels in blood and saliva in a low-income population of Detroit, Michigan","The relationships between blood lead (PbB) and saliva lead (PbSa) concentrations and the determinants of PbB and PbSa status in 970 low-income adults in the city of Detroit, Michigan were explored. Average PbB and PbSa values in the sample population were found to be 2.7+/-0.1 microg/dl and 2.4+/-0.13 microg/l (equivalent to 0.24+/-0.13 microg/dl), respectively, and a weak but statistically significant association was found between the lead levels in the two types of body fluid samples. The average PbB level for men (4.0+/-0.56 microg/dl) was higher than that for women (2.7+/-0.11 microg/dl); other significant predictors of PbB included age, level of education, being employed, income level, the presence of peeling paint on the wall at home and smoking. There was no gender- or age-dependent difference in blood saliva values but statistically significant correlations were found between PbSa and level of education, employment, income level and smoking. Dental caries was severe in this population. Only 0.5% of the participants had no clinical signs of caries, over 80% had cavitated carious lesions (i.e., lesions that had progressed into dentin), and the number of lost teeth and carious lesions averaged 3.4 and 30, respectively. Weak but significant associations were found between PbB as well as PbSa and measures of dental caries in the study population. The positive associations are believed to be a reflection of the fact that the risk factors for dental caries, especially in low-income populations of the US, overlap extensively with those of lead poisoning and may not have a causal significance.","2006","Michigan","None","social"
"Seasonal variations of lead concentration and loading rates in residential house dust in northern Idaho","Although lead hazards to humans have been known since ancient times and many regulatory actions and lead risk reductions have been achieved over the past century, lead contamination and exposure remain significant problems worldwide. The focus of this study was to investigate whether residential house dust lead concentrations and lead and dust loading rates in non-contaminated or ""background"" communities in northern Idaho are significantly affected by seasonal variations. House dust samples were obtained from 34 houses in five towns of northern Idaho from March to November 1999. There was evidence of significant seasonality of lead concentration in house dust in some towns, but no evidence in other towns. Because of the high variability between the towns and small sample sizes, it was difficult to make firm conclusions about seasonal patterns observed in house dust lead levels. A linear relationship between precipitation rates and dust loading rates was detected. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2006","Idaho","None","None"
"Binational study of pediatric blood lead levels along the United States/Mexico border","To evaluate lead exposure among children living in border communities, the states of Arizona and New Mexico in the United States (US), and the states of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico collaboratively requested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide technical assistance to document pediatric blood lead levels (BLLs) in children living along this part of the US/Mexico border. Two studies were conducted to evaluate BLLs of children aged 1-6 years. In 1998, 1210 children were tested in the Arizona/Sonora study; in 1999, 874 children were tested in New Mexico/Chihuahua. Overall geometric mean BLL was 32.5 microg/l (95% Confidence Interval 31.5-33.5) with BLLs ranging from below limit of detection to 320.0 microg/l. Mean BLLs were higher among children living on the Mexican side of the border (43.2 microg/l) compared to those on the US side (22.3 microg/l). Mean BLLs ranged from 14.9 to 31.2 microg/l at the US sites and from 26.9 to 55.2 microg/l at the Mexican sites. This study used a convenience sample and cannot be considered representative of the general population. Nonetheless, the range of mean BLLs among the sites and especially the higher mean BLLs among children living in the border communities in Mexico suggests different exposures to lead and warrants further attention.","2006","Arizona","None","None"

"Lead poisoning in Minnesota Medicaid children","This article presents data on blood-lead testing in Minnesota children from 1999 through 2003. The number of Minnesota children younger than 6 years of age who were tested for blood lead increased from approximately 38,000 in 1999 to 61,000 in 2003. The rate of blood-lead testing in 9- to 30-month-old children enrolled in Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare, the state's Medicaid programs for children, increased from 17% to 29% between 1999 and 2003. The rate of elevated blood-lead levels (10 microg/dL or greater) in all tested children declined from 6% in 1999 to 2.7% in 2003. However, the rate of elevated blood-lead levels in children enrolled in the 2 public programs in 2003 (3.4%) was 2-fold higher than that in children who were not on Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare (1.5%). The percentage of all children with elevated blood-lead levels who were retested within 3 months increased from 39% in 1999 to 50% in 2003.","2006","Minnesota","None","None"
"The effectiveness of low-cost soil treatments to reduce soil and dust lead hazards: The Boston lead safe yards low cost lead in soil treatment, demonstration and evaluation","The Boston lead safe yards low cost lead in soil treatment, demonstration, and evaluation was developed to explore the viability and effectiveness of low-cost soil interventions to reduce exposure to soil lead hazards. Buildings that had been abated for lead to Massachusetts's deleading standards in the previous 5 yrs and met other program requirements were recruited for the evaluation. Following individual property assessments, yards were treated with application of ground coverings and ground barriers in 2000-2001 and followed up at 1 yr. The treatment cost ranged from $1095 to $5643 with an average of $2798. Soil lead levels at the building dripline, measured with a field-portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer (Niton Model 702 Spectrum Analyzer), dropped from 2021 PPM at baseline to 206 PPM at 1-yr follow-up. Most of the barrier treatments continued to block access to the lead-contaminated soil at 1 yr. At the follow-up, few properties with grass treatment had areas that were completely bare, but 28% had more than a small amount of treated areas bare. Treatments were effective in reducing entryway dust lead in the rear of the building if the residents reported they had maintained the yard treatments. Each additional yard work activity reported was predicted to lower 1-yr floor dust lead loading at the rear common/main and dwelling unit entries by about 20%. Each additional 100 ft(2) of yard treated was predicted to lower 1-yr floor dust loading at the rear dwelling unit entry by 19%. Treatments did not show a dust lead effect at 1 yr in the front entryway of the building, but the investigators believe that this may be due to the effect of resident cleaning overshadowing the treatment effect.

"Blood lead levels in children and environmental lead contamination in Miami inner city, Florida","Studies have shown that the environmental conditions of the home are important predictors of health, especially in low-income communities. Understanding the relationship between the environment and health is crucial in the management of certain diseases. One health outcome related to the home environment among urban, minority, and low-income children is childhood lead poisoning. The most common sources of lead exposure for children are lead paint in older, dilapidated housing and contaminated dust and soil produced by accumulated residue of leaded gasoline. Blood lead levels (BLL) as low as 10 microg/dL in children are associated with impaired cognitive function, behavior difficulties, and reduced intelligence. Recently, it is suggested that the standard for intervention be lowered to BLL of 5 microg/dl. The objectives of our report were to assess the prevalence of lead poisoning among children under six years of age and to quantify and test the correlations between BLL in children and lead exposure levels in their environment. This cross-sectional analysis was restricted to 75 children under six years of age who lived in 6 zip code areas of inner city Miami. These locations exhibited unacceptably high levels of lead dust and soil in areas where children live and play. Using the 5 microg/dL as the cutoff point, the prevalence of lead poisoning among the study sample was 13.33%. The study revealed that lead levels in floor dust and window sill samples were positively and significantly correlated with BLL among children (p < 0.05). However, the correlations between BLL and the soil, air, and water samples were not significant. Based on this pilot study, a more comprehensive environmental study in surrounding inner city areas is warranted. Parental education on proper housecleaning techniques may also benefit those living in the high lead-exposed communities of inner city Miami.","2006","Florida","None","soil"
"Predicting children's blood lead levels from exposure to school drinking water in Seattle, Washington, USA","OBJECTIVE: Lead exposure through drinking water is of increasing interest with little known about its potential childhood health impact. In 2004, school testing in Seattle, Washington, found lead concentrations in drinking water that exceeded national guidelines (>20 ppb). On the basis of these data, we estimated potential blood lead levels (BLLs) in elementary school children to better understand the potential health risks posed by these exposures. METHODS: We used the US Environmental Protection Agency Integrated Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children to predict geometric mean BLLs. We modeled typical-case and worst-case scenarios for children in 71 elementary schools on the basis of drinking water lead concentrations results from 2004. RESULTS: The estimated geometric mean BLLs under a typical scenario for each school ranged from 1.6 to 2.5 microg/dL. The worst-case scenario predicted geometric mean BLLs ranging from 1.7 to 5.0 microg/dL. All modeling yielded predicted BLLs well below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public health goal of <10 microg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Our modeling suggests drinking water exposures up to 10-15 times the Environmental Protection Agency guideline are unlikely to result in BLLs exceeding the current guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the absence of other significant exposure sources. In Seattle, elevated school drinking water lead concentrations are not a significant source of lead exposure in school-age children. Further characterization of drinking water impacts are merited only if younger-age children are consuming water or if water lead concentrations are higher than those in this study.","2006","Washington","water","water"
"Inadequate prenatal care and elevated blood lead levels among children born in Providence, Rhode Island: a population-based study","OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine whether children born to mothers receiving inadequate prenatal care are at an increased risk for having an elevated blood lead level during early childhood. METHODS: The authors conducted a population-based study of children born in Providence, Rhode Island, from 1997 to 2001 whose mothers had received adequate, intermediate, or inadequate prenatal care. The children's blood lead levels were compared between groups using bivariate and logistic regression. To understand the regulatory implications and public health impact of changing the definition of an elevated blood lead level, ""elevated"" was defined as 5 microg/dL, 10 microg/dL, and 15 microg/dL. RESULTS: Children born to mothers who received inadequate prenatal care were at an elevated risk for having an elevated blood lead level later in life. This relationship remained statistically significant for each definition of elevated blood lead level and after controlling for other socio-economic status measures and birthweight (at 5 microg/dL, odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.68, p = 0.006; at 10 microg/dL, OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.26, 2.24, p < 0.0004; at 15 microg/dL, OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.10, 3.04, p = 0.019) represent an opportune moment to identify expectant mothers living in lead-contaminated environments. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that conducting lead screening as a regular part of prenatal care provision could help identify women possibly experiencing ongoing lead exposure and help reduce or prevent exposures to their offspring.","2006","Rhode Island","None","None"
"An economic impact assessment of lead exposure in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, USA: making the case for statewide remediation","Childhood lead poisoning is a major, preventable environmental health problem in the USA. The primary source of lead poisoning in children is exposure to deteriorating lead-based paint in older low-quality, low-income housing. The circumstance of concentrated poverty and the shortage of high quality low-income housing provide a recipe for increasing disease rates attributed to lead exposure. This paper assesses the economic impact of lead exposure in high-risk housing among children residing in the Commonwealth of Kentucky as measured by productivity and tax revenues lost. It examines remediation costs of high-risk housing statewide against the costs of exposure. Specifically, it examines the relationships between IQ and earnings potential, lost earnings and tax revenue generation, remediation costs and the cost of exposure, and it evaluates these costs against exposure reduction and suggests a strategy for comprehensive remediation activities that pays for itself over time. The results of this analysis determine that the long-term benefits of reducing the outcomes associated with lost productivity among young children per year due to lead exposure would generate sufficient tax revenue to pay for complete remediation of all high risk low-quality housing units in Kentucky.","2007","Kentucky","None","None"
"The status of childhood lead poisoning and prevention in Nevada, USA","One of the first steps in addressing the problem of childhood lead poisoning is to identify the possible sources of exposure in specific communities and target high-risk populations with appropriate interventions. Due to several factors, such as lack of funding and lack of blood lead reporting, little information exists regarding the occurrence of childhood lead poisoning and the prevalence of potential exposure sources in the state of Nevada. Following the recent establishment of a Nevada-based Lead Poisoning Program, we compiled the most current information available on Nevadans, and use this knowledge to suggest future research objectives and outreach activities for the state. Accordingly, we identify the characteristics of the vulnerable Nevada populations, explore possible sources of lead exposure unique to Nevada, and summarize the existing data on childhood lead poisoning. Emerging data indicates that Nevada is an area of rapid population growth, characterized by increasing immigration from Latin America, increasing numbers of children from low-income families with no health insurance. Also, childhood lead poisoning may arise from exposure to non-paint sources of lead. After presenting the Nevada statistics, we propose and recommend a set of research and outreach strategies that best suit the needs of Nevada residents.","2007","Nevada","None","social"
"Childhood lead poisoning prevention activities within Michigan local public health departments","Local public health departments have a wide array of responsibilities, including coordinating childhood lead poisoning prevention activities. This study was conducted in an effort to understand how local public health officers prioritized lead poisoning prevention activities and the barriers to the delivery of childhood lead poisoning prevention services delivered through local health departments. A telephone survey was conducted of health officers in Michigan, a state with a high burden of environmental lead. Analysis included Spearman rank correlation and Fisher's exact test. No association was found between the local risk of lead poisoning and the priority placed by local health departments on lead poisoning prevention activities. Similarly, there was no association between the local risk of lead poisoning and the availability of services. Only 60% of local health departments offered blood lead testing, environmental investigation, and case management. Most (74%) believed that lead poisoning is inadequately addressed within the area served by their local health department. New strategies of providing lead poisoning prevention activities are needed to achieve the federal and state goals of eliminating childhood lead poisoning over the next decade.","2007","Michigan","None","None"
"Changes in blood lead levels associated with use of chloramines in water treatment systems","BACKGROUND: More municipal water treatment plants are using chloramines as a disinfectant in order to reduce carcinogenic by-products. In some instances, this has coincided with an increase in lead levels in drinking water in those systems. Lead in drinking water can be a significant health risk. OBJECTIVES: We sought to test the potential effect of switching to chloramines for disinfection in water treatment systems on childhood blood lead levels using data from Wayne County, located in the central Coastal Plain of North Carolina. METHODS: We constructed a unified geographic information system (GIS) that links blood lead screening data with age of housing, drinking water source, and census data for 7,270 records. The data were analyzed using both exploratory methods and more formal multivariate techniques. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that the change to chloramine disinfection may lead to an increase in blood lead levels, the impact of which is progressively mitigated in newer housing. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing chloramines to reduce carcinogenic by-products may increase exposure to lead in drinking water. Our research provides guidance on adjustments in the local childhood lead poisoning prevention program that should accompany changes in water treatment. As similar research is conducted in other areas, and the underlying environmental chemistry is clarified, water treatment strategies can be optimized across the multiple objectives that municipalities face in providing high quality drinking water to local residents.","2007","North Carolina","water","water"
"Exposure to lead and length of time needed to make homes lead-safe for young children","OBJECTIVES: We determined the length of time needed to make homes lead-safe in a population of children aged 0 to 6 years with blood lead levels (BLLs) of 20 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL) or greater. Reducing this time would reduce children's exposure to lead. METHODS: Data came from the Wisconsin Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program's comprehensive blood lead surveillance system. Analysis was restricted to children whose first BLL test value during 1996-1999 was between 20 and 40 mug/dL and for whom housing intervention data were available (n=382). RESULTS: The median length of time required to make a home lead-safe was 465 days. Only 18% of children lived in homes that were made lead-safe within 6 months; 45% lived in homes requiring more than 18 months to be lead-safe. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are needed to reduce the time it takes to make a home lead-safe. Although abatement orders always include time limits, improved compliance with the orders must be enforced. Greater emphasis should be placed on securing lead-safe or lead-free housing for families, thus reducing lead exposure.","2007","Wisconsin","None","None"
"Use of a general toxicity test to predict heavy metal concentrations in residential soils","Significant clusters of developmental delay and mental retardation (DD/MR) were identified in children born in South Carolina. Although it is difficult to identify one factor that causes DD/MR, environmental insult including exposure of pregnant women to heavy metals c; in induce DD/MR in their children. Because it is expensive to measure the concentrations of individual metals in large numbers of environmental samples, the general Microtox((R)) toxicity test was used to identify highly toxic soil samples. Approximately 100 soil samples were collected from residential areas and analyzed to determine an effective concentration (EC(50)) of soil required to inhibit 50% light emission of the luminescent bacterial test organism (Vibrio fischeri). The EC(50) values were then transformed to relative toxicity units (RTU). A subset of 56 high and low toxicity soil samples was then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (EPA method 6010) for arsenic, lead, and chromium, which are known neurotoxins. The highest measured arsenic concentration was 30 times hi.,her than the South Carolina residential soil limit. Significant correlations were found between the RTU and soil arsenic and chromium concentrations. Microtox((R)) also identified some low arsenic and chromium samples as toxic, presumably because additional unidentified toxicants were present in the soil. In general, however, the Microtox((R)) test was effective in identifying soils with elevated concentrations of arsenic and chromium, even in residential neighborhoods where limited soil toxicity was expected.

"The association between demolition activity and children's blood lead levels","Urban renewal efforts are a priority for many American cities. As efforts to reconstitute urban centers increase, the demolition of old, deteriorated structures has accelerated. Recent studies have identified demolitions as a potential source of environmental lead exposure. We conducted a study examining the relationship between demolition activity and blood lead levels of children residing in neighborhoods where demolition activity occurred. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in St. Louis City, Missouri. The study period was January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002. Data were obtained from the Missouri Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program's (CLPPP) lead surveillance system and St. Louis Demolition Permit Database. Children were considered exposed to a demolition if they had a blood lead test within 45 days of any demolition on a census block. Exposure was classified as both a dichotomous (yes/no) and a categorical (none/one/multiple) variable and was analyzed separately. Linear regression models were developed to determine effects of demolitions on blood lead levels. A total of 1196 children 6-72 months of age living in 395 census blocks were included. 314 (26.3%) were exposed and 882 (73.7%) were unexposed to a demolition. In an adjusted model, exposure to multiple demolitions was found to have significant effects on children blood lead levels (coefficient=0.281; 95% CI=0.069, 0.493; P-value=0.010). Age of the child, race, and age of housing where children's resided were also significant predictors. This study suggests that multiple demolitions within a census block may significantly increase children's blood lead levels. The findings may be useful to municipal planners in older cities where demolitions are being used as an urban renewal tool.","2007","Missouri","None","None"
"Elevated lead in drinking water in Washington, DC, 2003-2004: the public health response","BACKGROUND: In 2003, residents of the District of Columbia (DC) experienced an abrupt rise in lead levels in drinking water, which followed a change in water-disinfection treatment in 2001 and which was attributed to consequent changes in water chemistry and corrosivity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the public health implications of the exceedance, the DC Department of Health expanded the scope of its monitoring programs for blood lead levels in children. METHODS: From 3 February 2004 to 31 July 2004, 6,834 DC residents were screened to determine their blood lead levels. RESULTS: Children from 6 months to 6 years of age constituted 2,342 of those tested; 65 had blood lead levels > 10 microg/dL (the ""level of concern"" defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the highest with a level of 68 microg/dL. Investigation of their homes identified environmental sources of lead exposure other than tap water as the source, when the source was identified. Most of the children with elevated blood lead levels (n = 46; 70.8%) lived in homes without lead drinking-water service lines, which is the principal source of lead in drinking water in older cities. Although residents of houses with lead service lines had higher blood lead levels on average than those in houses that did not, this relationship is confounded. Older houses that retain lead service lines usually have not been rehabilitated and are more likely to be associated with other sources of exposure, particularly lead paint. None of 96 pregnant women tested showed blood lead levels > 10 microg/dL, but two nursing mothers had blood lead levels > 10 microg/dL. Among two data sets of 107 and 71 children for whom paired blood and water lead levels could be obtained, there was no correlation (r(2) = -0.03142 for the 107). CONCLUSIONS: The expanded screening program developed in response to increased lead levels in water uncovered the true dimensions of a continuing problem with sources of lead in homes, specifically lead paint. This study cannot be used to correlate lead in drinking water with blood lead levels directly because it is based on an ecologic rather than individualized exposure assessment; the protocol for measuring lead was based on regulatory requirements rather than estimating individual intake; numerous interventions were introduced to mitigate the effect; exposure from drinking water is confounded with other sources of lead in older houses; and the period of potential exposure was limited and variable.","2007","Washington","water","water"

"Globalization, binational communities, and imported food risks: Results of an outbreak investigation of lead poisoning in Monterey County, California","Objectives. Although the burden of lead poisoning has decreased across developed countries, it remains the most prevalent environmental poison worldwide. Our objective was to investigate the sources of an outbreak of lead poisoning in Monterey County, California. Methods. An investigation in 3 county health department clinics in Monterey County, California, was conducted between 2001 and 2003 to identify risk factors for elevated blood lead levels (>= 10 mu g/dL) among children and pregnant women. Results. The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels was significantly higher in 1 of the 3 clinics (6% among screened children and 13% among prenatal patients). Risk factors included eating imported foods (relative risk [RR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2, 9.5) and having originated from the Zimatlan area of Oaxaca, Mexico, compared with other areas of Oaxaca (RR = 4.0; 95% CI = 1.7, 9.5). Home-prepared dried grasshoppers (chapulines) sent from Oaxaca were found to contain significant amounts of lead. Conclusions. Consumption of foods imported from Oaxaca was identified as a risk factor for elevated blood lead levels in Monterey County, California. Lead-contaminated imported chapulines were identified as 1 source of lead poisoning, although other sources may also contribute to the observed findings. Food transport between binational communities presents a unique risk for the importation 900-906.","2007","California","None","None"
"Do the same houses poison many children? An investigation of lead poisoning in Rochester, New York, 1993-2004","Objectives. In several cities, researchers have found that a discrete number of properties owned by a small number of owners house multiple lead poisoned children over time. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not a small number of properties were implicated in the poisoning of multiple children in Rochester, New York, between 1993 and 2004. Methods. We analyzed the patterns of ownership and repeated positive environmental investigations (i.e., documented lead hazards) in homes of lead poisoned children using county health department data during a 12-year period. Results. A small percentage (14.8%) of properties in which the health department found a lead hazard had previously documented lead hazards. When a second positive investigation occurred, the average elapsed time between investigations was a little less than three years. Only four property owners owned more than two properties that had multiple positive investigations. Conclusions. In some cities, a small number of properties or property owners provide housing for a large percentage of lead poisoned children. However, this situation is not universal. In Rochester, a relatively small percentage of homes that housed a child with an elevated blood lead level have a history of housing lead poisoned children. In cities like Rochester, lead hazard reduction resources should focus on high-risk housing stock determined by factors such as age, value, and condition, rather than on those with a prior record of housing lead poisoned children.","2007","New York","None","None"
"Northern Idaho house dust and soil lead levels compared to the bunker hill superfund site","House dust has been identified as a major exposure medium for lead (Pb) in children. High levels of Pb in soil and house dust have been recorded at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site (BHSS) in northern Idaho, an historic mining and smelting district. Soil and dust remediation at the site was required; however, regional background soil and dust Pb levels had not been well characterized. The objective of this survey was to determine background house dust Pb levels and to compare those levels with concentrations, and dust and Pb loading rates measured at the BHSS. Soil and house dust samples were collected in five towns demographically similar to the BHSS but unaffected by the mining industry. The background concentrations and loading rates were significantly lower than those observed at the site. House age was a significant factor affecting background soil and house dust Pb concentrations and loading rates.","2007","Idaho","None","soil"
"Using state lead poisoning surveillance system data to assess false positive results of capillary testing","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the false positive percentage of capillary blood lead screening in a statewide surveillance system and to explore potential predictors of false positive results. METHODS: Data were all blood lead tests of 0-5 year old children in Maine during 2002-2003. We determined the proportion of children with elevated (>/=10 microg/dL) capillary test results who received a venous confirmatory test, and calculated the percentage of false positive tests, defined as a capillary test of >/=10 microg/dL with a confirmatory venous test of <10 microg/dL. Multivariable binomial regression was used to determine whether capillary blood lead level and length of time between capillary and venous tests predicted false positive results, after controlling for potential confounders. We also examined the positive bias of the capillary test among both false positive and true positive results. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent of elevated capillary screening tests (2.2 percent of all capillary screening tests) were false positives. False positive results were less likely for capillary levels of 15-19 microg/dL (RR=0.78; 95% CI 0.5-0.92) and 20 microg/dL or above (RR=0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96) compared to 10-14 microg/dL. The percentage of false positives did not vary by interval between screening and confirmatory tests. The capillary test exhibited a positive bias compared to the venous test, even among true positive results. CONCLUSIONS: False positive results may have been caused by sample contamination, rather than laboratory error or true variation in blood lead level between screening and confirmatory tests. Capillary screening could be improved by training in proper sample collection methods.","2007","Maine","None","None"
"Nonlinear association between soil lead and blood lead of children in metropolitan New Orleans, Louisiana: 2000-2005","Metropolitan New Orleans is unique because it has a universal blood lead (BL) screening dataset (n=55,551) from 2000-2005 spatially coupled with a soil lead (SL) dataset (n=5467) completed in 2000. We evaluated empirical associations between measurements of SL and BL exposure responses of children in New Orleans by stratifying the databases by Census Tracts and statistically analyzing them with permutation methods. A consistent curvilinear association occurred annually between SL and BL with robust significance (P-values<10(-23)). The mathematical model of the pooled BL datasets for 2000-2005 is: BL=2.038+0.172 x (SL)(0.5) (agreement (R) of 0.534, an r(2) of 0.528, and a P-value of 1.0 x 10(-211)) indicating that chance alone cannot explain the association. Below 100 mg/kg SL children's BL exposure response is steep (1.4 microg/dL per 100 mg/kg), while above 300 mg/kg SL the BL exposure response is gradual (0.32 microg/dL per 100 mg/kg). In 1995, the BL prevalence was 37%>or=10 microg/dL for the most vulnerable poor and predominantly African-American children. In the era of universal screening the prevalence of elevated BL is 11.8%>or=10 microg/dL for the general population of children. The SL map describes community variations of potential BL exposure. If health effects occur at BL>or=2 microg/dL, then 93.5% of the children in New Orleans are at risk. These results reinforce the proposal that prevention of childhood Pb exposure must include SL remediation as demonstrated by a New Orleans pilot project and a proactive Norwegian government program.","2007","Louisiana","soil","soil"
"Cleaning efficacy of high-efficiency particulate air-filtered vacuuming and ""Dry Steam"" cleaning on carpet","Previous studies for lead exposure reduction have indicated the difficulty in reducing surface contamination of carpets with the use of regular vacuum cleaners. To find a solution, a household vacuum cleaner equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and a dust finder indicator, and a ""dry steam"" cleaner previously reported effective in reducing dust mite allergens in carpets and mattresses were tested for effectiveness in reducing lead dust in carpets. Fifty homes of lead-exposed children were tested in New Jersey. A selected carpet in the living area of each home was tested with two interventions: half was cleaned by HEPA vacuuming twice (VAC-VAC) and the other half by dry steaming between the two HEPA vacuumings (VAC-DSC-VAC). Wipe and vacuum samples, representing surface dust and total dust collections, respectively, were taken before and after cleaning. The wipe and vacuum sample data indicated that both cleaning methods substantially reduced dust lead levels (p < 0.001). The mean percent reductions in lead loading were approximately 29% and 40% for the VAC-VAC and VAC-DSC-VAC interventions, respectively. The difference between the two postcleaning levels was statistically significant by wipe sampling (p = 0.038) but was marginally insignificant by vacuum sampling (p = 0.072). A subset of sample data collected before repeat vacuuming (VAC-DSC) suggested that repeat vacuuming after dry steam cleaning is unnecessary. In summary, slow and steady HEPA vacuuming with the help of a dust finder indicator reduces surface and overall lead dust in carpets, and dry steam cleaning further reduces surface lead contamination as compared with HEPA vacuuming alone.","2008","New Jersey","None","air"
"Implementation of CDC refugee blood lead testing guidelines in Minnesota","The state of Minnesota undertook a trial of the 2005 recommendations for blood lead testing in refugees developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New refugee children younger than 16 years of age receiving health screening at an urban clinic were tested for elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) and nutritional status. Follow-up lead tests were obtained three to six months after the first test. During the course of the project, 150 refugee children received an initial blood lead test and nutritional blood tests, and 140 (93%) received a second blood lead test. Five children (3.3%) had EBLLs at the initial blood lead test and one child (0.7%) had an EBLL at the second test after a nonelevated first test result.

"The political ecology of lead poisoning in eastern North Carolina","In the United States, childhood blood lead levels have dropped substantially since 1991, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented new screening guidelines. Many states, including North Carolina, have established successful screening and intervention programs. Still, pockets of higher lead poisoning rates continue to be a problem in some geographic areas. One of these areas consists of several counties in eastern North Carolina. This cluster of higher rates cannot be explained by poverty and housing characteristics alone. Instead, the explanation requires an understanding of place that encompasses a range of historical, social, political, and economic processes. This paper utilizes a political ecology approach to provide a deeper understanding of how these processes can contribute to ill health.","2008","North Carolina","None","None"
"Reduction of elevated blood lead levels in children in North Carolina and Vermont, 1996-1999","BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined factors related to the time required for children's blood lead levels (BLLs) >= 10 mu g/dL to decline to < 10 mu g/dL. OBJECTIVES: We used routinely collected surveillance data to determine the length of time and risk factors associated with reducing elevated BLLs in children below the level of concern of 10 mu g/dL. METHODS: From the North Carolina and Vermont state surveillance databases, we identified a retrospective cohort of 996 children < 6 years of age whose first two blood lead tests produced levels >= 10 mu g/dL during 1996-1999. Data were stratified into five categories of qualifying BLLs and analyzed using Cox regression. Survival curves were used to describe the time until BLLs declined below the level of concern. We compared three different analytic methods to account for children lost to follow-up. RESULTS: On average, it required slightly more than 1 year (382 days) for a child's BLL to decline to < 10 mu g/dL, with the highest BLLs taking even longer. The BLLs of black children [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.99], males (HRmale = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98), and children from rural areas (HRrural = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.97) took longer to fall below 10 mu g/dL than those of other children, after controlling for qualifying BLL and other covariates. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that including censored children estimated a longer time for BLL reduction than when using linear interpolation or when excluding censored children. CONCLUSION: Children with high confirmatory BLLs, black children, males, and children from rural areas may need additional attention during case management to expedite their BLL reduction time to < 10 mu g/dL. Analytic methods that do not account for loss to follow-up may underestimate the time it takes for BLLs to fall below the recommended target level.","2008","North Carolina","None","None"

"Metal concentrations in rural topsoil in South Carolina: Potential for human health impact","Rural areas are often considered to have relatively uncontaminated soils; however few studies have measured metals in surface soil from low population areas. Many metals, i.e., arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg), have well-documented negative neurological effects, and the developing fetus and young children are particularly at risk. Using a Medicaid database, two areas were identified: one with no increased prevalence of mental retardation and developmental delay (MR/DD) (Strip 1) and one with significantly higher prevalence of MR/DD (Strip 2) in children compared to the state-wide average. These areas were mapped and surface soil samples were collected from 0-5 cm depths from nodes of a uniform grid laid out across the sampling areas. Samples were analyzed for As, barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), Pb, manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and Hg. inverse distance weighting (IDW) was used to estimate concentrations throughout each strip area, and a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify common sources. All metal concentrations in Strip 2, the MR/DD cluster area, were significantly greater than those in Strip 1 and similar to those found in more urban and highly agricultural areas. Both Strips 1 and 2 had a high number of significant correlations between metals (33 for Strip 1 and 25 for Strip 2), suggesting possible similar natural or anthropogenic sources which was corroborated by PICA. While exposures were not assessed and direct causation between environmental soil metal concentrations and MR/DD cannot be concluded, the high metal concentrations in areas with an elevated prevalence of MR/DD warrants further consideration.

"Risk factors for elevated blood lead levels among African refugee children in New Hampshire, 2004","OBJECTIVES: Surveillance blood lead screening of refugee children resettled in Manchester, NH, in 2004 revealed that 39 (42%) of 92 children had elevated levels (>or=10 microg/dL) after resettlement. Furthermore, 27/92 children (29%) had nonelevated screening blood lead levels on arrival (BLL1) but had elevated follow-up blood lead levels 3-6 months after settlement (BLL2). The main objective was to identify risk factors for increasing lead levels among refugee children after resettlement in Manchester in 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study, with completion of household interviews and home assessments for refugee families who had resettled in 2004 in Manchester, NH. Blood lead level (BLL) data were abstracted from the New Hampshire (NH) Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. To assess acute and chronic malnutrition among refugees, we used anthropometric data from International Organization of Migration documents to calculate nutritional indices. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 93 African refugee children in 42 families who participated, 60 (65%) had been born in a refugee camp. Median age was 5.5 years at the time of BLL2 measurement. Thirty-six (39%) of the refugee children had BLL2 >or= 10 microg/dL. Liberians and those born in refugee camps had higher geometric mean BLL2 than those not Liberian or not born in camps. Younger children and children with nutritional wasting before immigrating to the United States had a greater increase in geometric mean from BLL1 to BLL2, compared to older children and those without nutritional wasting. Follow-up blood lead testing of refugee children, particularly those resettled in areas with older housing stock, as in Manchester, is important for identifying lead exposure occurring after resettlement. Increased attention to improve nutritional status of children in refugee camps and after arrival in the United States and awareness of children who were born in refugee camps should be incorporated into lead-poisoning prevention strategies.","2008","New Hampshire","None","None"
"Soil lead (Pb) in residential transects through Lubbock, Texas: a preliminary assessment","Residential lead (Pb) contamination, resulting from decades-long use of leaded gasoline and lead-based paint, is likely to be present in soils in most urban areas. A screening level sampling effort demonstrated that Lubbock, Texas, USA, like other cities of its age and size, has areas of elevated soil Pb. This effort was based on soil sampling performed on residential, commercial and thoroughfare properties. The focus of this study was to investigate that component of soil contamination due to combustion of leaded gasoline. Soils were collected from the 1-2 cm surface layer from street-side property borders, well away from buildings that might lead to soil contamination from leaded paint chips. All samples were analyzed for Pb after a 1 M HNO3 mild extraction to determine the amount of bioavailable Pb. Two of three transects through the city demonstrated significant trends of decreasing Pb concentrations with distance from the city center, paralleling a decrease in developed property age. Peak soil Pb concentrations outside city development was 4.9 +/- 0.6 mg/kg while the median concentration for the city was 35.4 mg/kg. Peak soil Pb concentrations in the city center ranged from 90.0 to 174.0 mg/kg and decreased exponentially to 6.0-9.0 mg/kg at the furthest terminus of the residential transects.","2008","Texas","soil","soil"

"A Framework for Widespread Replication of a Highly Spatially Resolved Childhood Lead Exposure Risk Model","BACKGROUND: Preventive approaches to childhood lead poisoning are critical for addressing this longstanding environmental health concern. Moreover, increasing evidence of cognitive effects of blood lead levels < 10 mu g/dL highlights the need for improved exposure prevention interventions. OBJECTIVES: Geographic information system-based childhood lead exposure risk models, especially if executed at highly resolved spatial scales, can help identify children most at risk of lead exposure, as well as prioritize and direct housing and health-protective intervention programs. However developing highly resolved spatial data requires labor- and time-intensive geocoding and analytical processes. In this study we evaluated the benefit of increased effort spent geocoding in terms of improved performance of lead exposure risk models. METHODS: We constructed three childhood lead exposure risk models based on established methods but using different levels of geocoded data from blood lead surveillance, county tax assessors, and the 2000 U.S. Census for 18 counties in North Carolina. We used the results to predict lead exposure risk levels mapped at the individual tax parcel unit. RESULTS: The models performed well enough to identify high-risk areas for targeted intervention, even with a relatively low level of effort on geocoding. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of widespread replication of highly spatially resolved childhood lead exposure risk models. The models guide resource-constrained local health and housing departments and community-based organizations on how best to expend their efforts in preventing and mitigating lead exposure risk in their communities.","2008","North Carolina","None","None"

"A blood lead benchmark for assessing risks from childhood lead exposure","Lead exposure is an insidious problem, causing subtle effects in children at low exposure levels where clinical signs are not apparent. Although a target blood lead concentration (PbB) of ten micrograms per deciliter (10 mu g/dL) has been used as the basis for environmental decision-making in California for nearly two decades, recent epidemiologic evidence suggests a relationship between cognitive deficits and Pb-B at concentrations <10 mu g/dL. Based on a published meta-analysis of children's IQ scores and their blood lead concentrations, we developed a new blood lead benchmark: an incremental increase in blood lead concentration (Delta Pb-B) of 1 mu g/dL, an increase that we estimate could decrease the IQ score in an average school child in California by up to one point. Although there is no evidence to date for a threshold for the neurobehavioral effects of lead, a one-point IQ decrement was chosen to represent a de minimus change. To safeguard the intellectual potential of all children, additional efforts to reduce or eliminate multiple-source exposures to lead are warranted.","2009","California","None","None"
"Children with elevated blood lead levels related to home renovation, repair, and painting activities--New York State, 2006-2007","Although blood lead levels (BLLs) >/=10 microg/dL are associated with adverse behavioral and developmental outcomes, and environmental and medical interventions are recommended at >/=20 microg/dL, no level is considered safe. A 1997 analysis conducted by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) indicated that home renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) activities were important sources of lead exposure among children with BLLs >/=20 microg/dL in New York state (excluding New York City) during 1993--1994. Subsequently, local health departments in New York state began to routinely collect information about RRP activities when investigating children's home environments for lead sources. This report updates the 1997 analysis with data from environmental investigations conducted during 2006--2007 in New York state (excluding New York City) for 972 children with BLLs >/=20 microg/dL. RRP activities were identified as the probable source of lead exposure in 139 (14%) of the 972 children. Resident owners or tenants performed 66% of the RRP work, which often included sanding and scraping (42%), removal of painted materials or structures (29%), and other activities (29%) that can release particles of lead-based paint. RRP activities continued to be an important source of lead exposure during 2006--2007. Children living in housing built before 1978 (when lead-based paint was banned from residential use) that are undergoing RRP activities should be considered at high risk for elevated BLLs, and appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent exposure.","2009","New York","None","None"
"Potential health impacts of heavy-metal exposure at the Tar Creek Superfund site, Ottawa County, Oklahoma","The potential impact of exposure to heavy metals and health problems was evaluated at the Tar Creek Superfund site, Ottawa County, Oklahoma, USA. Observed versus expected mortality was calculated for selected conditions in the County and exposed cities. Excess mortality was found for stroke and heart disease when comparing the exposed County to the state but not when comparing the exposed cities to the nonexposed rest of the County. However, sample sizes in the exposed area were small, population emigration has been ongoing, and geographic coding of mortality data was incomplete. In an exposed community, 62.5% of children under the age of 6 years had blood lead levels exceeding 10 microg/dl. The relationships between heavy-metal exposure and children's health and chronic disease in adults are suggestive that a more thorough investigation might be warranted. A number of possible environmental and health studies are suggested, including those focusing on possible central nervous system impacts. Unfortunately, the exposed population is dispersing. One lesson learned at this site is that health studies need to be conducted as soon as possible after an environmental problem is identified to both study the impact of the most acute exposures and to maximize study sample size-including those exposed to higher doses-and minimize the loss of individuals to follow-up.","2009","Oklahoma","None","None"

"Screening for lead poisoning: a geospatial approach to determine testing of children in at-risk neighborhoods","OBJECTIVE: To develop a spatial strategy to assess neighborhood risk for lead exposure and neighborhood-level blood lead testing of young children living in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. STUDY DESIGN: This ecologic study used existing blood lead results of children aged <or=36 months tested and living in one of Atlanta's 236 neighborhoods in 2005. Geographic information systems used Census, land parcel, and neighborhood spatial data to create a neighborhood priority testing index on the basis of proxies for poverty (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children [WIC] enrollment) and lead in house paint (year housing built). RESULTS: In 2005, only 11.9% of Atlanta's 18,627 children aged <or=36 months living in the city had blood lead tests, despite a high prevalence of risk factors: 75,286 (89.6%) residential properties were built before 1978, and 44% of children were enrolled in WIC. Linear regression analysis indicated testing was significantly associated with WIC status (P < .001) but not with old housing.

"Blood lead levels and growth status among African-American and Hispanic children in Dallas, Texas--1980 and 2002: Dallas Lead Project II","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation is to analyze childhood blood lead levels and growth status (ages 2-12) in Dallas, Texas lead smelter communities in the 1980s and 2002, where smelters operated from 1936 to 1990. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A sample of convenience study design was used in two cohorts (n=360): 1980-1989 (n=191) and 2002 (n=169). Multivariate analysis of variance and covariance and tandem multiple regressions were used to evaluate the association between stature and blood lead level in two time periods. RESULTS: In 2002 average child blood lead level (1.6 microg/dL+/-0.2 SE) was significantly (p<0.001) lower compared to the 1980 cohort mean level (23.6 microg/dL+/-1.3 SE). Average height and weight in 2002 were 4.5 cm and 4.0 kg greater, respectively, than in 1980. Lowered blood lead level was associated with 3.9 cm, 3.5 kg and 1.1 units greater height, weight and body mass index (BMI), respectively. Cohort effect was associated with greater height (0.6 cm), weight (0.5 kg) and BMI (0.1). CONCLUSION: This investigation reports on child growth in a community before and after the transition from high to low blood lead levels over several decades. Using child growth as a proxy, health status of Dallas's lead smelter communities increased markedly over the past two decades, primarily because of lower blood lead levels, while the poverty rate was only marginally lower.","2009","Texas","None","None"
"Childhood lead poisoning associated with lead dust contamination of family vehicles and child safety seats - Maine, 2008","Persons employed in high-risk lead-related occupations can transport lead dust home from a worksite through clothing, shoes, tools, or vehicles. During 2008, the Maine Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (MCLPPP) identified 55 new cases of elevated (>or=15 microg/dL) venous blood lead levels (BLLs) among children aged <6 years through mandated routine screening. Although 90% of childhood lead poisoning cases in Maine during 2003-2007 had been linked to lead hazards in the child's home, no lead-based paint or dust or water with elevated lead levels were found inside the homes associated with six of the 2008 cases (i.e., five families, including one family with two affected siblings). An expanded environmental investigation determined that these six children were exposed to lead dust in the family vehicles and in child safety seats. The sources of the lead dust were likely household contacts who worked in high-risk lead exposure occupations. Current recommendations for identifying and reducing risk from take-home lead poisoning include 1) ensuring that children with elevated BLLs are identified through targeted blood lead testing, 2) directing prevention activities to at-risk workers and employers, and 3) improving employer safety protocols. State and federal prevention programs also should consider, when appropriate, expanded environmental lead dust testing to include vehicles and child safety seats.","2009","Maine","None","water"
"Age of Greatest Susceptibility to Childhood Lead Exposure: A New Statistical Approach","BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to lead toxicity is often assumed to be greatest during early childhood (e.g., 2 years of age), but recent studies suggest that blood lead concentrations (BPb) taken at 5-7 years of age are more strongly associated with IQ. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the age of greatest susceptibility to lead exposure using an innovative statistical approach that avoids the problem of correlated serial BPb measurements. METHODS: We analyzed two cohorts of children that were followed from infancy to 6 years of age in Rochester, New York (n = 211), and Cincinnati, Ohio (n = 25 1). Serial BPb levels were measured and IQ tests were done when children were 6 years of age. After adjustment for relevant covariates, the ratio of 6-year BPb to 2-year BPb was added to the multiple regression model to test whether the pattern of BPb profiles during childhood had additional effect on IQ. RESULTS: The ratio of BPb at 6 years to the BPb at 2 years showed a strong effect on IQ (P < 0.001) when added to the multiple regression model that included the average childhood BPb. IQ decreased by 7.0 points for children whose BPb at 6 years of age was 50% greater than that at 2 years compared with children whose 6-year BPb was 50% less than their 2-year BPb. Similarly, criminal arrest rates were a factor of 3.35 higher for those subjects whose 6-year BPb was 50% higher than their 2-year BPb. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 6-year BPb is more strongly associated with cognitive and behavioral development than is BPb measured in early childhood.","2009","New York","None","None"

"Hunting with lead: association between blood lead levels and wild game consumption","BACKGROUND: Wild game hunting is a popular activity in many regions of the United States. Recently, the presence of lead fragments in wild game meat, presumably from the bullets or shot used for hunting, has raised concerns about health risks from meat consumption. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between blood lead levels (PbB) and wild game consumption. METHODS: We recruited 742 participants, aged 2-92 years, from six North Dakota cities. Blood lead samples were collected from 736 persons. Information on socio-demographic background, housing, lead exposure source, and types of wild game consumption (i.e., venison, other game such as moose, birds) was also collected. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the association between PbB and wild game consumption. RESULTS: Most participants reported consuming wild game (80.8%) obtained from hunting (98.8%). The geometric mean PbB were 1.27 and 0.84 microg/dl among persons who did and did not consume wild game, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, persons who consumed wild game had 0.30 microg/dl (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.44 microg/dl) higher PbB than persons who did not. For all game types, recent (<1 month) wild game consumption was associated with higher PbB. PbB was also higher among those who consumed a larger serving size (> or = 2 oz vs. <2 oz); however, this association was significant for 'other game' consumption only. CONCLUSIONS: Participants who consumed wild game had higher PbB than those who did not consume wild game. Careful review of butchering practices and monitoring of meat-packing processes may decrease lead exposure from wild game consumption.","2009","North Dakota","None","None"
"Migration of Contaminated Soil and Airborne Particulates to Indoor Dust","We have developed a modeling and measurement framework for assessing transport of contaminated soils and airborne particulates into a residence, their subsequent distribution indoors via resuspension and deposition processes, and removal by cleaning and building exhalation of suspended particles. The model explicitly accounts for the formation of house dust as a mixture of organic matter (OM) such as shed skin cells and organic fibers, soil tracked-in on footwear, and particulate matter (PM) derived from the infiltration of outdoor air. We derived formulas for use with measurements of inorganic contaminants, crustal tracers, OM, and PM to quantify selected transport parameters. Application of the model to residences in the U.S. Midwest indicates that As in ambient air can account for nearly 60% of the As input to floor dust with soil track-in representing the remainder. Historic data on Pb contamination in Sacramento, CA, were used to reconstruct sources of Pb in indoor dust showing that airborne Pb was likely the dominant source in the early 1980s. However, as airborne Pb levels declined due to the phase-out of leaded gasoline, soil resuspension and track-in eventually became the primary sources of Pb in house dust.","2009","California","None","soil"
"Children's blood lead and standardized test performance response as indicators of neurotoxicity in metropolitan New Orleans elementary schools","This study analyzes pre-Katrina variation in aggregate student performance and children's blood lead (BPb) in 117 elementary school districts in metropolitan New Orleans. Fourth grade student achievement on Louisiana Educational Assessment Program (LEAP) tests were analyzed as a function of BPb for children 1-6 years old within school districts, controlling for student-teacher ratios, percent of students eligible for a free or discounted lunch, and school racial demography. Measures of performance across subject areas (English Language Arts, Science, Mathematics, and Social Studies) include school Achievement Test Scores (ATS) and indices of agreement and variation in student achievement. ATS are measured on a 5-point scale, corresponding to achievement categories of advanced = 5 to unsatisfactory = 1. Regression results show that median BPb (mu g/dL) and percent of children with BPb > 10 mu g/dL are significantly associated with reductions in test scores across all subjects and depress variation in student performance across achievement categories. These data suggest that assisting children with improved school performance requires alleviation of pre-school Pb exposure and its associated neurotoxic damage. Cost-benefit calculations suggest that it is more cost effective to pay for onetime primary prevention instead of paying continuous expenses focused on reversing neurotoxic damage.

"Potential for Atmospheric-Driven Lead Paint Degradation in the South Coast Air Basin of California","Exposure to lead in paint or lead residues in house dust and soil is one of the leading environmental risks to the health of children in the United States. Components of photochemical smog can increase the degradation of binders in lead paint, leading to increased release of lead pigment granules to hands in surface contact or for deposition in house dust and soil. This study uses photochemical air quality modeling to map areas susceptible to increased lead paint degradation as a result of photochemical atmospheric pollutants to prioritize areas of concern. Typical air quality episodes in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) are modeled for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Results indicate that large areas of the SoCAB were susceptible to atmospheric-driven accelerated lead paint degradation. Inner city urban areas from central Los Angeles to Azusa and most of Orange County had the highest susceptibility to accelerated lead paint degradation, followed by inland locations near the San Bernardino Mountains. This study identifies photochemical oxidant gases as contributors to greater lead release from indoor painted surfaces in urban areas.","2009","California","air","air"
"Comparing Lead Poisoning Risk Assessment Methods: Census Block Group Characteristics vs. Zip Codes as Predictors","Objective. We determined which children should be tested for elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in the face of financial and practical barriers to universal screening efforts and within 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations allowing health departments to develop BLL screening strategies. Methods. We used the Michigan database of BLL tests from 1998 through 2005, which contains address, Medicaid eligibility, and race data. Linking addresses to U.S. Census 2000 data by block group provided neighborhood sociodemographic and housing characteristics. To derive an equation predicting BLL, we treated BLL as a continuous variable and used Hierarchical Linear Modeling to estimate the prediction equation. Results. Census block groups explained more variance in BLL than tracts and much more than dichotomized zip code risk (which is current pediatric practice). Housing built before 1940, socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic characteristics of the block group, child characteristics, and empirical Bayesian residuals explained more than 41% of the variance in BLL during 1998-2001. By contrast, zip code risk and Medicaid status only explained 15% of the BLL variance. An equation using 1998-2001 BLL data predicted well for BLL tests performed in 2002-2005. While those who received BLL tests had above-average risk, this method produced minimal bias in using the prediction equation for all children. Conclusions. Our equation offers better specificity and sensitivity than using dichotomized zip codes and Medicaid status, thereby identifying more high-risk children while also offering substantial cost savings. Our prediction equation can be used with a simple Internet-based program that allows health-care providers to enter minimal information and determine whether a BLL test is recommended.","2010","Michigan","None","None"
"Spatial analysis of bioavailable soil lead concentrations in Los Angeles, California","Lead (Pb) poisoning causes permanent neurologic and developmental disorders and remains an important environmental health problem for US children, despite removal of Pb from gasoline and household paints. To better understand the contribution of Pb from historical traffic and residential Pb based paint to soil Pb concentrations in Los Angeles, we analyzed 550 soil Pb samples from south central Los Angeles County, CA, in relation to land-use patterns (commercial, industrial, residential, and parks and open areas) and proximity to freeways, highways, and major arterials. House age variables (surrogates of historical Pb-based paint) and traffic index variables (surrogates of historical traffic) were created at different buffer distances (10-5000 m). Total and bioavailable Pb concentrations near freeways and major arterials were significantly higher than those collected elsewhere. Total and bioavailable Pb concentrations were highly correlated (r=0.96) after the removal of one outlier. Both parcel-age related variables and traffic variables were important predictors of current soil bioavailable Pb concentrations. Average age of parcels within 30 m and length of small streets within 3000 m explained 57% and 38% of the variance, respectively, in soil bioavailable Pb concentrations in residential areas away from freeways and major arterials (N=44). Road length of freeways within 750 m explained 28% of bioavailable PI) concentrations in parks and open areas (N=26). Multi-variable regression models predicted 16-61% of the variances in bioavailable Pb concentrations, depending on land-use type and spatial relationship to roadways. Based on these models a map of spatial distributions of soil Pb concentrations was created for the Los Angeles area that shows promise as a screening tool to evaluate continued Pb poisoning in children.

"Metal concentrations in schoolyard soils from New Orleans, Louisiana before and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita","The long-term environmental impact and potential human health hazards resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita throughout much of the United States Gulf Coast, particularly in the New Orleans, Louisiana, USA area are still being assessed and realized after more than four years. Numerous government agencies and private entities have collected environmental samples from throughout New Orleans and found concentrations of contaminants exceeding human health screening values as established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for air, soil, and water. To further assess risks of exposure to toxic concentrations of soil contaminants for citizens, particularly children, returning to live in New Orleans following the storms, soils collected from schoolyards prior to Hurricane Katrina and after Hurricane Rita were screened for 26 metals. Concentrations exceeding USEPA Regional Screening Levels (USEPA-RSL), total exposure, non-cancer endpoints, for residential soils for arsenic (As), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), and thallium (TI) were detected in soil samples collected from schoolyards both prior to Hurricane Katrina and after Hurricane Rita. Approximately 43% (9/21) of schoolyard soils collected prior to Hurricane Katrina contained Pb concentrations greater than 400 mg kg(-1), and samples from four schoolyards collected after Hurricane Rita contained detectable Pb concentrations, with two exceeding 1700 mg kg(-1). Thallium concentrations exceeded USEPA-RSL in samples collected from five schoolyards after Hurricane Rita. Based upon these findings and the known increased susceptibility of children to the effects of Pb exposure, a more extensive assessment of the soils in schoolyards, public parks and other residential areas of New Orleans for metal contaminants is warranted.

"Blood lead screening among newly arrived refugees in Minnesota","During the last 10 years, the prevalence rate of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in the general population in the United States has decreased, while the rate of EBLLs among refugee children in this country has remained high. Because of this, national guidelines recommend both an initial and a repeat screening of refugee children. To explore blood lead screening among refugee children in Minnesota, we examined data on 1,256 children who arrived in Minnesota between 2004 and 2007. Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of refugee children who are screened for blood lead; identify the characteristics of refugee children with an EBLL following screening; and describe the characteristics of refugee children who received a repeat blood lead test. Our results showed that approximately 6% of refugee children in Minnesota had an EBLL and fewer than half of all refugee children in the sample received a repeat test. For that reason, primary care providers should be periodically reminded of the importance of repeat lead screening for refugee children.","2010","Minnesota","None","None"
"LEAD DISTRIBUTIONS AND RISKS IN NEW ORLEANS FOLLOWING HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA","During the last four years, significant effort has been devoted to understanding the effects that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had on contaminant distribution and redistribution in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, and the surrounding Gulf Coast area. Elevated concentrations were found for inorganic contaminants (including As, Fe, Pb, and V), several organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and volatiles) and high concentration of bioaerosols, particularly Aeromonas and Vibrio. Data from different research groups confirm that some contaminant concentrations are elevated, that existing concentrations are similar to historical data, and that contaminants such as Ph and As may pose human health risks. Two data sets have been compiled in this article to serve as the foundation for preliminary risk assessments within greater New Orleans. Research from the present study suggests that children in highly contaminated areas of New Orleans may experience Pb exposure from soil ranging from 1.37 mu g/d to 102 mu g/d. These data are critical in the evaluation of children's health. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:1429-1437. (C) 2010 SETAC","2010","Louisiana","None","soil"
"Barriers to Pediatric Lead Screening: Implications From a Web-Based Survey of Vermont Pediatricians","The pernicious effects of lead on child health are well documented. The Vermont Department of Health (VDH) recommends screening all 12- and 24-month-old children for elevated blood lead levels (BLL). In 2006, only 41.4% of 24-month-old Vermont children were screened. To identify barriers preventing pediatricians from performing blood lead screening, a survey was distributed to Vermont primary care pediatricians-divided in higher and lower screening groups. Vermont pediatricians were more likely to be lower screeners if they reported negative health outcomes began at BLL > 10 mu g/dL (odds ratio [OR] = 3.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-11.99), practiced in Chittenden County (OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.14-9.78), or disagreed with the VDH's recommendation (OR = 4.90, 95% CI = 1.66-15.50). Adjusted analysis indicated the most significant determinants of lower screening rates were male gender, a perceived dangerous BLL as > 10 mu g/dL and low self-reported Medicaid population. The VDH may have an opportunity to increase BLL screening emphasizing the significant health risks associated with BLL = 10 mu g/dL.","2010","Vermont","None","None"
"Community- and family-level factors influence care-giver choice to screen blood lead levels of children in a mining community","CONTEXT: Bunker Hill, in Kellogg, Idaho, formerly a lead mine (1884-1981) and smelter (1917-1981), is now a Superfund site listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List. Lead contamination from the site is widespread due to past smelter discharges to land, water, and air, placing children at risk for both exposure to lead and resultant health effects of lead. Since 1983, the EPA has used child blood lead levels to inform the clean-up standards for the Bunker Hill Superfund site. This study was undertaken to examine factors that have contributed to the significant fall-off in the rates and numbers of children being screened for blood lead in Kellogg (number screened decreased from 195 to 8 from 2002 to 2007). The goal of this research project was to define community- and family-level factors which influence care-giver choice to screen blood lead levels of their children in this environment. METHODS: This formative research study used mixed methods and was comprised of three research components: (1) preliminary interviews using community-based participatory research methods to define key research questions of relevance to community members, government and NGOs working in relation to the Bunker Hill clean-up; (2) a quantitative analysis of a cross-sectional household survey conducted with adult care-givers about child blood lead screening in Kellogg; and (3) ethnographic community rapid assessment methods formed the in-depth interview process and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The survey showed the likelihood of blood lead screening that for children under the age of 18 years increases 34% with each one-year increase in current age of the child (95% CI, 1.08-1.67, p-value=0.009), and decreases 45% with annual household income greater than $10,000 (95% CI, 0.35-0.88, p-value=0.013). Sibling birth order increased the likelihood of blood lead screening by 61% (95% CI, 1.04-2.48, p-value=0.032) for each successive child. Female children were rated by their care-givers as 3.7 times less agitated or easily angered than male children (95% CI, 1.5-8.8, p-value=0.005). Across all levels of interviews, regulators, residents, and non-governmental organization representatives reported that Kellogg's long history as a mining town has continued to influence attitudes and actions of care-givers to access blood lead screening for their children. The mining context has been described as instilling stigmas, parental blame and a sense of shame about lead exposure and resultant health effects. DISCUSSION: Children under 6 years of age are currently the least likely to have been screened for lead in Kellogg and screening rates decreased in the 2000s. According to most indicators, socio-economic status did not influence the likelihood of a care-giver to screen children's blood lead levels. However, children in homes with an annual income below $10,000 were more likely to have been screened than the rest of the population. Former concerted screening efforts, including outreach, support, follow-up, and financial incentives in the 1980s-1990s to screen children, may have influenced low-income residents. Programmatic outreach for children under 6 years of age in Kellogg should focus on increasing female child and first child blood lead screening, rather than targeting only low-income families, by improving approaches to promotion, implementation and environmental follow-up for child lead screening. Some families have resided in Kellogg for five to six generations, and the long-term mining context influences community values and perceptions of lead exposure and screening for children through a conflicted combination of pride in the mining history, attachment to the past economy that supported the community in juxtaposition to the personalized blame, shame, guilt, and stigma associated with children having high blood lead levels. Health communication and other programs should prioritize methods of reducing parental feelings of blame, shame and guilt, and stigmas associated with the health effects of lead in a way that respects the pride of former mine workers, their families, and the history of the town.","2010","Idaho","social","air"
"Reduction in the Prevalence of Lead-Containing Jewelry in California Following Litigation and Legislation","Exposure to lead-containing jewelry has been identified as one cause of elevated blood lead levels Because of the significant health effects of lead exposure, litigation and legislation in California set standards for lead content of children's and adult jewelry We measured compliance with these standards for jewelry sold at 42 major retailers statewide. During a one-year period, we purchased over 1500 pieces of jewelry and used a two-step process (X-ray fluorescence analysis followed by laboratory verification) to identify noncompliant jewelry. About 4% of the jewelry we purchased did not comply with California lead standards, dramatically less jewelry with high lead content than has been measured in the past in California and in other states. We identified violations at 26 retailers The violations were not restricted to particular types of jewelry or a particular price range Most violations exceeded state standards by at least 2x The most common violation was the ""lobster-claw"" clasp often used on necklaces Litigation and legislation have been effective tools for reducing the prevalence of jewelry with high lead content in California We are continuing our monitoring for at least another year with a goal of reducing the frequency of jewelry in violation of California lead standards to near zero.","2010","California","None","None"
"Blood lead levels in Mississippi children","Lead is toxic to the nervous system and has been shown to have deleterious effects on the developing nervous systems of children. Widespread exposure to lead has occurred in the past due to the use of lead as a gasoline additive and as a paint additive. Children are usually exposed to lead in the home. Prevention of exposure to lead through monitoring is the most effective way to reduce childhood toxicity. Lead levels were determined in 24,736 children in Mississippi. The percentage of 1-5-year-old children with blood lead levels >10 microg/dL in Mississippi is less than those seen nationally, and mean levels are comparable to national ones. In Mississippi, the age of housing is not a viable predictor of risk for elevated lead levels in children.","2010","Mississippi","None","None"

"An Evaluation of Lead Contamination in Plastic Toys Collected from Day Care Centers in the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada, USA","Childhood exposure to environmental lead continues to be a major health concern. This study examined lead content within the plastic of children's toys collected from licensed day care centers in the Las Vegas valley, Nevada. It was hypothesized that the use of lead as a plastics stabilizer would result in elevated lead (a parts per thousand yen600 ppm) in polyvinyl chloride plastics (PVC) compared to non-PVC plastics. It was also hypothesized that, due to the use of lead chromate as a coloring agent, yellow toys would contain higher concentrations of lead (a parts per thousand yen600 ppm) than toys of other colors. Toy samples were limited to those found in day care centers in Las Vegas, Nevada. 10 day care centers were visited and approximately 50 toy samples were taken from each center. Of the 535 toys tested, 29 contained lead in excess of 600 parts per million (ppm). Of those 29 toys, 20 were PVC and 17 were yellow. Both of the two hypotheses were strongly supported by the data.","2010","Nevada","None","None"
"Evaluating and Regulating Lead in Synthetic Turf","BACKGROUND: In 2007, a synthetic turf recreational field in Newark, New Jersey, was closed because lead was found in synthetic turf fibers and in surface dust at concentrations exceeding hazard criteria. Consequently, public health professionals across the country began testing synthetic turf to determine whether it represented a lead hazard. Currently, no standardized methods exist to test for lead in synthetic turf or to assess lead hazards. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to increase awareness of potential lead exposure from synthetic turf by presenting data showing elevated lead in fibers and turf-derived dust; identify risk assessment uncertainties; recommend that federal and/or state agencies determine appropriate methodologies for assessing lead in synthetic turf; and recommend an interim standardized approach for sampling, interpreting results, and taking health-protective actions. DISCUSSION: Data collected from recreational fields and child care centers indicate lead in synthetic turf fibers and dust at concentrations exceeding the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 statutory lead limit of 300 mg/kg for consumer products intended for use by children, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's lead-dust hazard standard of 40 mu g/ft(2) for floors. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic turf can deteriorate to form dust containing lead at levels that may pose a risk to children. Given elevated lead levels in turf and dust on recreational fields and in child care settings, it is imperative that a consistent, nationwide approach for sampling, assessment, and action be developed. In the absence of a standardized approach, we offer an interim approach to assess potential lead hazards when evaluating synthetic turf.","2010","New Jersey","None","None"

"Concentration of metals in blood of Maine children 1-6 years old","Blood lead concentrations are higher in young children than in other age groups, whereas little is known regarding concentrations of other metals in young children. We measured the concentrations of a suite of metals in the blood of children 1-6 years of age, and assessed potential differences by age, season, or region of Maine. We used blood submitted to the Maine State Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory for blood lead analysis to determine the concentrations of arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), tin (Sn), and uranium (U) in 1350 children 1-6 years of age. The essential metals Mn and Se were detected in all samples, and As and Sb were detected in >90% of samples. Hg was detected in approximately 60% of samples. U and Cd were less often detected in blood samples, at approximately 30% and 10% of samples, respectively. Sn was not detected in any sample. Concentrations of As, Hg, and Se increased with age, whereas Sb decreased with age. Concentrations also varied by season and region for some though not all metals. Significant pairwise correlations were observed for a number of metals. Blood is a reasonable compartment for measurement of most of these metals in young children. The use of convenience samples provided a cost-effective mechanism for assessing exposure of young children in Maine.","2010","Maine","None","None"
"Association between children's blood lead levels, lead service lines, and water disinfection, Washington, DC, 1998-2006","OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of changes in the water disinfection process, and presence of lead service lines (LSLs), on children's blood lead levels (BLLs) in Washington, DC. METHODS: Three cross-sectional analyses examined the relationship of LSL and changes in water disinfectant with BLLs in children <6 years of age. The study population was derived from the DC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program blood lead surveillance system of children who were tested and whose blood lead test results were reported to the DC Health Department. The Washington, DC Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) provided information on LSLs. The final study population consisted of 63,854 children with validated addresses. RESULTS: Controlling for age of housing, LSL was an independent risk factor for BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL, and ≥ 5 μg/dL even during time periods when water levels met the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). When chloramine alone was used to disinfect water, the risk for BLL in the highest quartile among children in homes with LSL was greater than when either chlorine or chloramine with orthophosphate was used. For children tested after LSLs in their houses were replaced, those with partially replaced LSL were >3 times as likely to have BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL versus children who never had LSLs. CONCLUSIONS: LSLs were a risk factor for elevated BLLs even when WASA met the EPA water action level. Changes in water disinfection can enhance the effect of LSLs and increase lead exposure. Partially replacing LSLs may not decrease the risk of elevated BLLs associated with LSL exposure.","2011","Washington","water","water"

We also investigated the incidence of BLL increases and BLLs newly elevated to 20 μg/dL or higher in the year following initial testing, along with associated factors. METHODS: We merged data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Refugee and Immigrant Health Program and the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program on 1148 refugee children younger than 7 years who arrived in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2007. RESULTS: Elevated BLL prevalence was 16% among newly arrived refugee children. The rate ratio for BLL elevation to 20 μg/dL or higher after arrival was 12.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2, 24.5) compared with children in communities the state defines as high-risk for childhood lead exposure. Residence in a census tract with older housing (median year built before 1950) was associated with a higher rate of BLL increases after resettlement (hazard ratio = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2, 2.3).

Household risk factors associated with both lead and asthma were examined. METHOD: We undertook a cross-sectional study involving children residing in mainly low-income and minority households in Michigan which were identified by the Statewide Systemic Tracking of Elevated Lead Levels and Remediation database (STELLAR) (n=356 children). RESULTS: Of the 356 index children, 19% had EBLLs and 15% were doctor-diagnosed asthmatic. After adjusting for confounders known to be related to lead poisoning and/or asthma, association remained between asthmatic children and EBLL children (AOR: 5.17; 95% CI (1.25-21.37)). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that asthmatic children are over 5 times more likely to have EBLLs than non-asthmatics (AOR: 5.17; 95% CI (1.25-21.37)).

"Predicting potentially plant-available lead in contaminated residential sites","Lead (Pb)-based paints pose a serious health problem to people living in residential settings constructed prior to 1978. Children are at a greater risk to Pb exposure resulting from hand-to-mouth activity in Pb-contaminated residential soils. For soil Pb, the most environmentally friendly, potentially cheap, and visually unobtrusive in situ technology is phytoremediation. However, the limiting factor in a successful phytoremediation strategy is the availability of Pb for plant uptake. The purpose of this study was to establish a relationship between soil properties and the plant-available/exchangeable Pb fraction in the selected Pb-based paint-contaminated residential sites. We selected 20 such sites from two different locations (San Antonio, Texas and Baltimore, Maryland) with varying soil properties and total soil Pb concentrations ranging between 256 and 4,182 mg kg(-1). Despite higher Pb levels in these soils that exceeds US EPA permissible limit of 400 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), it is known that the plant-available Pb pools are significantly lower because of their sorption to soil components such as organic matter, Fe-Mn oxides, and clays, and their precipitation in the form of carbonates, hydroxides, and phosphates. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering showed that the potentially plant-available Pb fraction is controlled by soil pH in the case of acidic Baltimore soils, while soil organic matter plays a major role in alkaline San Antonio soils. Statistical models developed suggest that Pb is likely to be more available for plant uptake in Baltimore soils and a chelant-assisted phytoextraction strategy will be potentially necessary for San Antonio soils in mobilizing Pb from complexed pool to the plant-available pool. A thorough knowledge of site-specific factors is therefore essential in developing a suitable and successful phytoremediation model.","2011","Maryland","None","soil"

"Probability of intellectual disability is associated with soil concentrations of arsenic and lead","Background: The association between metals in water and soil and adverse child neurologic outcomes has focused on the singular effect of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As). This study describes the complex association between soil concentrations of As combined with Pb and the probability of intellectual disability (ID) in children. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort design with 3988 mother child pairs who were insured by Medicaid and lived during pregnancy and early childhood in South Carolina between 1/1/97 and 12/31/02. The children were followed until 6/1/08, using computerized service files, to identify the diagnosis of ID in medical records and verified by either school placement or disability service records. The soil was sampled using a uniform grid and analyzed for eight metals. The metal concentrations were interpolated using Bayesian Kriging to estimate concentration at individual residences. Results: The probability of ID increased for increasing concentrations of As and Pb in the soil. The Odds Ratio for ID, for one unit change in As was 1.130 (95% confidence interval 1.048-1.218) for Pb was 1.002 (95% confidence interval 1.000-1.004). We identified effect modification for the infants based on their birth weight for gestational age status and only infants who were normal size for their gestational age had increased probability of ID based on the As and Pb soil concentrations (OR for As at normal weight for gestational age = 1.151 (95% Cl: 1.061-1.249) and OR for Pb at normal for gestational age = 1.002 (95% CI: 1.002-1.004)). For normal weight for gestational age children when As = 22 mg kg(-1) and Pb = 200 mg kg(-1) the risk for ID was 11% and when As = 22 mg kg(-1) and Pb = 400 mg kg(-1) the probability of ID was 65%. Conclusion: The probability of ID is significantly associated with the interaction between Pb and As for normal weight for gestational age infants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Lead Poisoning Among Burmese Refugee Children-Indiana, 2009","Recent routine screening revealed multiple cases of unexplained lead poisoning among children of Burmese refugees living in Fort Wayne, Indiana. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine (a) the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) among Burmese children and (b) potential sources of lead exposure. A case was defined as an elevated venous BLL (>= 10 mu g/dL); prevalence was compared with all Indiana children screened during 2008. Environmental and product samples were tested for lead. In all, 14 of 197 (7.1%) children had elevated BLLs (prevalence ratio: 10.7) that ranged from 10.2 to 29.0 mu g/dL. Six cases were newly identified; 4 were among US-born children. Laboratory testing identified a traditional ethnic digestive remedy, Daw Tway, containing a median 520 ppm lead. A multilevel linear regression model identified daily use of thanakha, an ethnic cosmetic, and Daw Tway use were related to elevated BLLs (P < .05). Routine monitoring of BLLs among this population should remain a priority.","2011","Indiana","None","None"
"Exposure sources and reasons for testing among women with low blood lead levels","Previous research has focused on highly elevated blood lead (PbB). This study examined reasons for testing and potential sources of exposure among women with PbBs less than 0.72 μmol/l (15 μg/dl). A questionnaire was mailed to 18- to 49-year-old women in upstate New York, USA, who were PbB tested in 2007. The most common testing reason was pregnancy among 125 women who returned the questionnaire. Among women tested for PbB during pregnancy, doctors ordered approximately 80% of tests regardless of lead level. Few women with PbBs less than 0.24 μmol/l (5 μg/dl) reported a potential source of lead exposure. However, among women with PbBs of 0.24-0.71 μmol/L (5-14.9 μg/dl), 29.2% had a job and 21.2% had a hobby with potential lead exposure. There are systematic differences in reasons for testing and exposure sources among women with PbBs less than 0.72 μmol/l and these differences have implications for screening.","2011","New York","None","None"
"Lead poisoning among Arab American and African American children in the Detroit metropolitan area, Michigan","This study explored the hypothesis that acculturation is a risk factor for childhood lead poisoning in the Detroit area of Michigan. Blood lead levels (BLLs) were determined in 429 Arab American and African American children, aged 6 months to 15 years, who were receiving well-child examination in three Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) clinics in the city. Mean BLL was 3.8 ± 2.3 μg/dL (range: 1-18 μg/dL) and 3.3% of the children tested had blood lead values above the 10 μg/dL level of concern. Neither the age of the dwelling units nor ethnicity of the child was significantly associated with the BLL. Multivariable analyses instead identified a number of acculturation-related factors that are associated with elevation in blood lead including paternal education, language spoken at home (English only, English and Arabic, or Arabic only), home ownership, smoking in the home, and exposure of child to home health remedies. The difference in blood lead between Arab American children from families where Arabic only versus Arabic and English is spoken at home was found to be statistically significant. This study provides information showing that immigrant children are at heightened risk of being poisoned by lead which can be useful in identifying groups at risk of atypical exposures.","2011","Michigan","None","None"
"Galvanic corrosion after simulated small-scale partial lead service line replacements","Partial replacement of lead pipe with copper pipe in the distribution system was expected to reduce lead contamination of water and offer significant public health benefits. The practice drew closer scrutiny after Washington, D.C., implemented the most extensive and expensive lead service line replacement program in US history and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked partial replacement of lead pipes to increased incidence of high blood lead levels in children living in D.C. As part of the Lead and Copper Rule long-term revisions, partial lead service line replacement is being reevaluated. In this timely laboratory study, partial replacement of lead pipe with copper pipe had unintended consequences of creating a ""battery"" between the two metals and increasing lead corrosion, thereby elevating lead levels in drinking water. Alternatives to partial lead replacement with copper should be considered before utilities expend limited financial resources on a practice that may not always yield the desired public health gains.","2011","Washington","None","water"
"A geospatial analysis of the effects of aviation gasoline on childhood blood lead levels","BACKGROUND: Aviation gasoline, commonly referred to as avgas, is a leaded fuel used in small aircraft. Recent concern about the effects of lead emissions from planes has motivated the U.S. Environmental Protection to consider regulating leaded avgas. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the relationship between lead from avgas and blood lead levels in children living in six counties in North Carolina. METHODS: We used geographic information systems to approximate areas surrounding airports in which lead from avgas may be present in elevated concentrations in air and may also be deposited to soil. We then used regression analysis to examine the relationship between residential proximity to airports and North Carolina blood lead surveillance data in children 9 months to 7 years of age while controlling for factors including age of housing, socioeconomic characteristics, and seasonality. RESULTS: Our results suggest that children living within 500 m of an airport at which planes use leaded avgas have higher blood lead levels than other children. This apparent effect of avgas on blood lead levels was evident also among children living within 1,000 m of airports. The estimated effect on blood lead levels exhibited a monotonically decreasing dose-response pattern, with the largest impact on children living within 500 m. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated a significant association between potential exposure to lead emissions from avgas and blood lead levels in children. Although the estimated increase was not especially large, the results of this study are nonetheless directly relevant to the policy debate surrounding the regulation of leaded avgas.","2011","North Carolina","None","air"
"Rochester's Lead Law: Evaluation of a Local Environmental Health Policy Innovation","BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made in reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning in the United States in the past three decades. However, the prevalence of elevated blood lead in children >= 10 mu g/dL) remains high in some communities, particularly those with high proportions of pre-1978 housing in poor condition. Increasingly, municipalities are using local policy tools to reduce lead poisoning in high-risk areas, but little is known about the effectiveness of such policies. OBJECTIVES: In this article, we evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive rental housing-based lead law adopted in Rochester, New York, in 2005. METHODS: This policy evaluation integrates analyses of city inspections data, a survey of landlords, landlord focus groups, and health department data on children's blood lead levels from the first 4 years of implementation of the 2005 law. RESULTS: Implementation has proceeded consistent with projected numbers of inspections with nearly all target units inspected in the first 4 years. Higher than expected inspection passage rates suggest that landlords have reduced lead hazards in rental housing affected by the law. Implementation of the lead law does not appear to have had a significant impact on the housing market. CONCLUSIONS: Although many uncertainties remain, our analysis suggests that the lead law has had a positive impact on children's health. Strong enforcement, support for community-based lead programs, and ongoing intergovernmental coordination will be necessary to maintain lead-safe housing in Rochester. Lessons learned from the Rochester experience may inform future local lead poisoning prevention policies in other communities.","2012","New York","None","None"
"Environmental Lead after Hurricane Katrina: Implications for Future Populations","BACKGROUND: As a result of Hurricane Katrina, > 100,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and a significant amount of sediment was deposited throughout the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. Researchers have identified the potential for increased lead hazards from environmental lead contamination of soils. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the distribution of residential soil and dust lead 2 years poststorm and compared soil lead before and after the storm. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in New Orleans in which households were selected by stratified random sampling. A standard residential questionnaire was administered, and lead testing was performed for both the interior and exterior of homes. Logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of interior and exterior lead levels in excess of allowable levels. RESULTS: One hundred nine households were enrolled; 61% had at least one lead measurement above federal standards. Of homes with bare soil, 47% had elevated lead and 27% had levels exceeding 1,200 ppm. Housing age was associated with soil lead, and housing age and soil lead were associated with interior lead. Race, income, and ownership status were not significantly associated with either interior or exterior lead levels. The median soil lead level of 560 ppm was significantly higher than the median level of samples collected before Hurricane Katrina. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence (61%) of lead above recommended levels in soil and dust samples in and around residences raises concern about potential health risks to the New Orleans population, most notably children. Steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of exposure to lead-contaminated soil and dust. Further research is needed to quantify the possible contribution of reconstruction activities to environmental lead levels.","2012","Louisiana","None","soil"
"Re-suspension of lead contaminated urban soil as a dominant source of atmospheric lead in Birmingham, Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh, USA","Soils in older areas of cities are highly contaminated by lead, due largely to past use of lead additives in gasoline, the use of lead in exterior paints, and industrial lead sources. Soils are not passive repositories and periodic re-suspension of fine lead contaminated soil dust particulates (or aerosols) may create seasonal variations of lead exposure for urban dwellers. Atmospheric soil and lead aerosol data from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) database were obtained for Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Detroit (Michigan), Chicago (Illinois), and Birmingham (Alabama), USA. In this study the temporal variations of atmospheric soil and lead aerosols in these four US cities were examined to determine whether re-suspended lead contaminated urban soil was the dominant source of atmospheric lead. Soil and lead-in-air concentrations were examined to ascertain whether lead aerosols follow seasonal patterns with highest concentrations during the summer and/or autumn. In addition, atmospheric soil and lead aerosol concentrations on weekends and Federal Government holidays were compared to weekdays to evaluate the possibility that automotive turbulence results in re-suspension of lead contaminated urban soil. The results show that the natural logs of atmospheric soil and lead aerosols were associated in Pittsburgh from April 2004 to July 2005 (R-2 = 0.31, p < 0.01), Detroit from November 2003 to July 2005 (R-2 = 0.49, p < 0.01), Chicago from November 2003 to August 2005 (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.01), and Birmingham from May 2004 to December 2006 (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.01). Atmospheric soil and lead aerosols followed seasonal patterns with highest concentrations during the summer and/or autumn. Atmospheric soil and lead aerosols are 3.15 and 3.12 times higher, respectively, during weekdays than weekends and Federal Government holidays, suggesting that automotive traffic turbulence plays a significant role in re-suspension of contaminated roadside soils and dusts. In order to decrease urban lead aerosol concentrations, lead deposition and subsequent children's seasonal exposure, lead contaminated urban soils need remediation or isolation because the legacy of lead continues to pose unnecessary and preventable health risks to urban dwellers.

"Lead in Drinking Water: Sampling in Primary Schools and Preschools in South Central Kansas","Studies in Philadelphia, New York City, Houston, Washington, DC, and Greenville, North Carolina, have revealed high lead levels in drinking water. Unlike urban areas, lead levels in drinking water in suburban and rural areas have not been adequately studied. In the study described in this article, drinking water in primary schools and preschools in five suburban and rural south central Kansas towns was sampled to determine if any exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) guidance level for schools and child care facilities of 20 parts per billion (ppb). The results showed a total of 32.1% of the samples had detectable lead levels and 3.6% exceeded the U.S. EPA guidance level for schools and child care providers of 20 ppb. These results indicate that about one-third of the drinking water consumed by children age six and under in the five suburban and rural south central Kansas towns studied has some lead contamination, exposing these children to both short-term and long-term health risks.

"The effects of the urban built environment on the spatial distribution of lead in residential soils","Lead contamination of urban residential soils is a public health concern. Consequently, there is a need to delineate hotspots in the landscape to identify risk and facilitate remediation. Land use is a good predictor of some environmental pollutants. However, in the case of soil lead, research has shown that land use is not a useful proxy. We hypothesize that soil lead is related to both individual landscape features at the parcel scale and the landscape context in which parcels are embedded. We sampled soil lead on 61 residential parcels in Baltimore, Maryland using field-portable x-ray fluorescence. Thirty percent of parcels had average lead concentrations that exceeded the USEPA limit of 400 ppm and 53% had at least one reading that exceeded 400 ppm. Results indicate that soil lead is strongly associated with housing age, distance to roadways, and on a parcel scale, distance to built structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Road Dust Lead (Pb) in Two Neighborhoods of Urban Atlanta, (GA, USA)","Road dust continues to be a major potential reservoir of Pb in the urban environment, and an important potential component of child Pb exposure. This study presents ICP-AES analyses of metals in 72 samples of road dust (<250 mu m) collected in the urban core of Atlanta, Georgia. In the Downtown area, median Pb concentrations are similar to 63 mg/kg Pb, with high values of 278 mg/kg. For comparison, median Pb values in a nearby residential neighborhood (also in the urban core) were similar to 93 mg/kg, with a high of 972 mg/kg. Geospatial variability is high, with significant variation observed over tens to hundreds of meters. Spearman Rank Correlation tests suggest that Pb and other metals (Cu, Ni, V, Zn) are associated with iron and manganese oxide phases in the residential area, as reported in other cities. However, Pb in the Downtown area is not correlated with the others, suggesting a difference in source or transport history. Given these complexities and the expected differences between road dust and soil Pb, future efforts to assess exposure risk should therefore be based on spatially distributed sampling at very high spatial resolution.","2012","Georgia","social","None"

"Infant lead poisoning associated with use of tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria--Boston, Massachusetts, 2011","Lead is highly toxic and can damage the brain, kidneys, bone marrow, and other body systems; high levels can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Young children are especially susceptible to lead exposures because of their floor-hand-mouth activity, greater gut absorption, and developing central nervous systems. In June 2011, a male infant aged 6 months of Nigerian descent was referred to the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) at Boston Children's Hospital because of an elevated blood lead level (BLL). An investigation found no lead exposure except for ""tiro,"" a Nigerian cosmetic that also is used as a folk remedy to promote visual development. The tiro applied to the infant's eyelids contained 82.6% lead. Products similar to tiro, such as ""surma"" and ""kajal"" in Asia and kohl in the Middle East, also might contain lead. This case adds to the medical literature documenting nonpaint lead sources as causes of elevated BLLs in children and highlights persons of certain immigrant populations as a risk group. Educational efforts are needed to inform immigrants from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East that tiro and similar products can cause lead poisoning in children. Health-care providers and public health workers should ask about eye cosmetics and folk remedies when seeking a source of exposure in children with elevated BLLs from certain immigrant populations.","2012","Massachusetts","None","None"
"The urban rise and fall of air lead (Pb) and the latent surge and retreat of societal violence","We evaluate air Pb emissions and latent aggravated assault behavior at the scale of the city. We accomplish this by regressing annual Federal Bureau of Investigation aggravated assault rate records against the rise and fall of annual vehicle Pb emissions in Chicago (Illinois), Indianapolis (Indiana), Minneapolis (Minnesota), San Diego (California), Atlanta (Georgia), and New Orleans (Louisiana). Other things held equal, a 1% increase in tonnages of air Pb released 22 years prior raises the present period aggravated assault rate by 0.46% (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.64). Overall our model explains 90% of the variation in aggravated assault across the cities examined. In the case of New Orleans, 85% of temporal variation in the aggravated assault rate is explained by the annual rise and fall of air Pb (total = 10,179 metric tons) released on the population of New Orleans 22 years earlier. For every metric ton of Pb released 22 years prior, a latent increase of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.83, p<0.001) aggravated assaults per 100,000 were reported.

In the case of New Orleans, 85% of temporal variation in the aggravated assault rate is explained by the annual rise and fall of air Pb (total = 10,179 metric tons) released on the population of New Orleans 22 years earlier. For every metric ton of Pb released 22 years prior, a latent increase of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.83, p<0.001) aggravated assaults per 100,000 were reported. Vehicles consuming fuel containing Pb additives contributed much larger quantities of Pb dust than generally recognized. Our findings along with others predict that prevention of children's lead exposure from lead dust now will realize numerous societal benefits two decades into the future, including lower rates of aggravated assault.

"Efforts to identify at-risk children for blood lead screening in pediatric clinics--Clark County, Nevada","BACKGROUND: Childhood lead poisoning continues to be a public health problem; however, lead screening rates remain low in many areas. Our objective is to increase screening in pediatric clinics, while testing a questionnaire for its predictability of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). METHODS: Participants were approached at pediatric clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada. A brief questionnaire assessed the child's potential exposure to lead and a blood sample was collected from each child. RESULTS: Of 564 children tested, 35 had detectable BLLs. Two questions from the questionnaire demonstrated significant differences in proportions (Fisher's exact test: P < .05) of affirmative/negative responses, for the 35 participants with detectable BLLs. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire failed to identify reliable associations between detectable BLLs and affirmative responses, limiting its use as an in-office tool. More research is recommended to identify and alleviate barriers to childhood lead screening in the clinical setting and to develop more applicable risk assessment tools.","2012","Nevada","None","None"
"Take-home lead exposure among children with relatives employed at a battery recycling facility - Puerto Rico, 2011","The recycling of lead has increased during the past 20 years, with more workers and their families potentially being exposed to lead from recycling facilities, including facilities that recycle lead-acid batteries. During November 2010-May 2011, four voluntary blood lead screening clinics for children of employees of a battery recycling facility in Puerto Rico were conducted. A total of 227 persons from 78 families had blood lead tests. Among 68 children aged <6 years, 11 (16%) had confirmed blood lead levels (BLLs) ≥10 µg/dL, the BLL at which CDC recommended individual intervention to reduce BLLs in 2010, and 39 (57%) children aged <6 years had venous or capillary BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, the reference value for elevated BLLs in children established by CDC in 2012. To determine whether take-home lead exposure contributed to the children's BLLs of ≥10 µg/dL, vehicle and household environmental samples were collected and analyzed. Eighty-five percent of vehicle dust samples and 49% of home dust samples exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) level of concern of ≥40 µg/ft² (430.6 µg/m²) [corrected]. EPA began clean-up of employee homes and vehicles, focusing first on homes with children with BLLs ≥10 µg/dL. EPA also required that the company set up shower facilities, shoe washes, and clean changing areas at the battery recycling facility. Lastly, CDC assigned a case manager to provide education, environmental follow-up, and case management of all children with BLLs ≥5 µg/dL. On average, children's BLLs have decreased 9.9 µg/dL since being enrolled in case management.","2012","Puerto Rico","None","social"
"Blood lead level analysis among refugee children resettled in New Hampshire and Rhode Island","OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between refugee status and elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) among children living in two U.S. cities and to assess the effect of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for BLL testing of newly emigrated refugee children for EBLLs. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: A longitudinal study was conducted of 1,007 refugee children and 953 nonrefugee children living, when blood testing occurred, in the same buildings in Manchester, New Hampshire and Providence, Rhode Island. MEASURES: Surveillance and blood lead data were collected from both sites, including demographic information, BLLs, sample type, refugee status, and age of housing. RESULTS: Refugee children living in Manchester were statistically significantly more likely to have an EBLL compared with nonrefugee children even after controlling for potential confounders.

"Associations between soil lead concentrations and populations by race/ethnicity and income-to-poverty ratio in urban and rural areas","Lead (Pb) is a well-studied environmental contaminant that has many negative health effects, especially for children. Both racial/ethnic and income disparities have been documented with respect to exposure to Pb in soils. The objectives of this study were to assess whether soil Pb concentrations in rural and urban areas of South Carolina USA, previously identified as having clusters of intellectual disabilities (ID) in children, were positively associated with populations of minority and low-income individuals and children (<= 6 years of age). Surface soils from two rural and two urban areas with identified clusters of ID were analyzed for Pb and concentrations were spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighted analysis. Population race/ethnicity and income-to-poverty ratio (ITPR) from United States Census 2000 block group data were aerially interpolated by block group within each area. Urban areas had significantly higher concentrations of Pb than rural areas. Significant positive associations between black, non-Hispanic Latino, individuals and children <= 6 years of age and mean estimated Pb concentrations were observed in both urban (r = 0.38, p = 0.0007) and rural (r = 0.53, p = 0.04) areas. Significant positive associations also were observed between individuals and children with an ITPR < 1.00 and Pb concentrations, though primarily in urban areas. Racial/ethnic minorities and low ITPR individuals, including children, may be at elevated risk for exposure to Pb in soils.","2013","South Carolina","soil","soil"
"Linking source and effect: resuspended soil lead, air lead, and children's blood lead levels in Detroit, Michigan","This study evaluates atmospheric concentrations of soil and Pb aerosols, and blood lead levels (BLLs) in 367839 children (ages 0-10) in Detroit, Michigan from 2001 to 2009 to test a hypothesized soil → air dust → child pathway of contemporary Pb risk. Atmospheric soil and Pb show near-identical seasonal properties that match seasonal variation in children's BLLs. Resuspended soil appears to be a significant underlying source of atmospheric Pb. A 1% increase in the amount of resuspended soil results in a 0.39% increase in the concentration of Pb in the atmosphere (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.50%). In turn, atmospheric Pb significantly explains age-dependent variation in child BLLs. Other things held equal, a change of 0.0069 μg/m(3) in atmospheric Pb increases BLL of a child 1 year of age by 10%, while approximately 3 times the concentration of Pb in air (0.023 μg/m(3)) is required to induce the same increase in BLL of a child 7 years of age. Similarly, a 0.0069 μg/m(3) change in air Pb increases the odds of a child <1 year of age having a BLL ≥ 5 μg/dL by a multiplicative factor of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.37). Overall, the resuspension of Pb contaminated soil explains observed seasonal variation in child BLLs.","2013","Michigan","soil","soil"
"Early childhood lead exposure and academic achievement: evidence from Detroit public schools, 2008-2010","OBJECTIVES: We assessed the long-term effect of early childhood lead exposure on academic achievement in mathematics, science, and reading among elementary and junior high school children. METHODS: We linked early childhood blood lead testing surveillance data from the Detroit Department of Health and Wellness Promotion to educational testing data from the Detroit, Michigan, public schools. We used the linked data to investigate the effect of early childhood lead exposure on academic achievement among school-aged children, both marginally and adjusted for grade level, gender, race, language, maternal education, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: High blood lead levels before age 6 years were strongly associated with poor academic achievement in grades 3, 5, and 8. The odds of scoring less than proficient for those whose blood lead levels were greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter were more than twice the odds for those whose blood lead levels were less than 1 micrograms per deciliter after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood lead exposure was negatively associated with academic achievement in elementary and junior high school, after adjusting for key potential confounders. The control of lead poisoning should focus on primary prevention of lead exposure in children and development of special education programs for students with lead poisoning.","2013","Michigan","None","None"
"Spatial relationships between lead sources and children's blood lead levels in the urban center of Indianapolis (USA)","Urban children remain disproportionately at risk of having higher blood lead levels than their suburban counterparts. The Westside Cooperative Organization (WESCO), located in Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana, has a history of children with high blood lead levels as well as high soil lead (Pb) values. This study aims at determining the spatial relationship between soil Pb sources and children's blood lead levels. Soils have been identified as a source of chronic Pb exposure to children, but the spatial scale of the source-recipient relationship is not well characterized. Neighborhood-wide analysis of soil Pb distribution along with a furnace filter technique for sampling interior Pb accumulation for selected homes (n = 7) in the WESCO community was performed. Blood lead levels for children aged 0-5 years during the period 1999-2008 were collected. The study population's mean blood lead levels were higher than national averages across all ages, race, and gender. Non-Hispanic blacks and those individuals in the Wishard advantage program had the highest proportion of elevated blood lead levels. The results show that while there is not a direct relationship between soil Pb and children's blood lead levels at a spatial scale of ~100 m, resuspension of locally sourced soil is occurring based on the interior Pb accumulation. County-wide, the largest predictor of elevated blood lead levels is the location within the urban core. Variation in soil Pb and blood lead levels on the community level is high and not predicted by housing stock age or income. Race is a strong predictor for blood lead levels in the WESCO community.","2013","Indiana","social","soil"
"Lead-Based Paint Awareness, Work Practices, and Compliance During Residential Construction and Renovation","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently implemented the Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) rule that applies to pre-1978 residences because of the potential presence of lead-based paint. Enforcement of this rule may be difficult and therefore it is crucial to understand the awareness and beliefs of contractors and the general public because these will likely be major determinants of exposures resulting from residential renovation work. The study described in this article utilized two mailed surveys: one directed to the general public and the other directed to contractors. The surveys were conducted in New Jersey and Virginia. Field observations were also recorded for work sites in New Jersey. Results indicated a high awareness among the general public about the hazards of lead, a low level of screening by children's doctors for lead exposure, frequent use of work practices that generate lots of dust, poor hygiene among contractors, and the potential for low compliance of contractors with the RRP rule. In particular, contractors who do not believe lead is a serious health hazard are expected to have the lowest compliance with the RRP rule. These findings serve as targets for effective public health interventions through education and outreach.","2013","New Jersey","None","None"

"An evaluation of lead concentrations in imported hot sauces","In the last decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several warnings and recalls for food products that exceed FDA standards for lead. Products containing chili peppers and salt were often suspected as sources of lead contamination, and included items such as candy that are routinely investigated. However, products such as hot sauces that contain similar ingredients have not been the focus of evaluations. This study quantified lead concentrations in imported hot sauces, evaluated product compliance to existing United States standards, and calculated potential dietary lead exposure for children using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model. Finally, recommendations for reducing the risk of lead exposure from hot sauces are provided. Twenty-five (25) bottles of imported hot sauces manufactured in Mexico and South America were purchased in Clark County, Nevada. All hot sauces were analyzed for lead concentrations, pH, and leaded packaging. Hot sauces were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and packaging was analyzed using x-ray fluorescence technology. Four brands of hot sauces (16%) exceeded 0.1ppm lead, the current FDA action level for lead in candy. Hot sauces with lead concentrations >0.1ppm lead contained salt and were manufactured in Mexico. Subsequent analysis of additional lots of hot sauces exceeding 0.1ppm lead revealed inconsistent lead concentrations between and within manufacturer lots. The lead concentrations of the plastic hot sauce lids ranged from below the limit of detection to 2,028ppm lead. There was no association between lead concentrations in hot sauces and pepper type. These results indicate the need for more rigorous screening protocols for products imported from Mexico, the establishment of an applicable standard for hot sauce, and resources to allow for the enforcement of existing food safety policies. The data reported herein represent the first known investigation of lead concentrations in hot sauces.","2013","Nevada","None","None"
"Childhood lead exposure associated with the use of kajal, an eye cosmetic from Afghanistan - Albuquerque, New Mexico, 2013","Lead is a toxic metal that damages blood cells, the kidneys, the cardiovascular system, and the developing nervous system. The risk for lead exposure causing subsequent cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits is especially high among toddlers because of their hand-to-mouth activities and their higher absorption of ingested lead compared with adults. In January 2013, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) received a report from an Albuquerque clinic of a refugee child aged 20 months (patient 1) with an elevated blood lead level (BLL) of 27.0 µg/dL (CDC reference value = 5.0 µg/dL). Medical staff informed NMDOH that the child and family used kajal, a traditional eye cosmetic brought from Afghanistan, their country of origin. Further investigation revealed that patient 1's brother, aged 4 months (patient 2), also had an elevated BLL of 33.5 µg/dL. Laboratory analysis of kajal used by the family showed a lead content of 54%. These two cases highlight the potential for lead poisoning among refugee populations in the United States and call attention to contaminated consumer products as a source of lead exposure. Physicians who provide health services to refugee and immigrant children should be aware of this potential exposure. Health-care providers who routinely screen refugee and immigrant children for elevated BLLs should consider asking questions about the use of traditional eye cosmetics.","2013","New Mexico","None","None"
"Practice-based evidence informs environmental health policy and regulation: A case study of residential lead-soil contamination in Rhode Island","Prior to 1978, the exteriors of Rhode Island's municipal water towers were painted with lead-containing paint. Overtime, this lead-containing paint either flaked-off or was mechanically removed and deposited on adjacent residential properties. Residents challenged inconsistencies across state agencies and federal requirements for collecting and analyzing soil samples. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the efficacy of Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) soil sampling regulations in determining the extent of lead contamination on residential properties using real world data. Researchers interviewed key government personnel, reviewed written accounts of events and regulations, and extracted and compiled lead data from environmental soil sampling on 31 residential properties adjacent to six municipal water towers. Data were available for 498 core samples. Approximately 26% of the residential properties had lead soil concentrations >1000 mg/kg. Overall, lead concentration was inversely related to distance from the water tower. Analysis indicated that surface samples alone were insufficient to classify a property as ""lead safe"". Potential for misclassification using RIDOH regulations was 13%. For properties deemed initially ""lead free"", the total number of samples was too few to analyze. Post-remediation lead-soil concentrations suggest the extent of lead contamination may have been deeper than initially determined. Additional data would improve the ability to draw more meaningful and generalized conclusions. Inconsistencies among regulatory agencies responsible for environmental health obfuscate transparency and erode the public's trust in the regulatory process. Recommendations for improvement include congruency across departmental regulations and specific modifications to lead-soil sampling regulations reflective of lowered CDC reference blood lead value for children 1 to 5 years old (5 mu g/dL). While scientific research informed the initial development of these environmental health policies and regulations, practice-based evidence did not support their efficacy in context of real world practice.

"Primary prevention of lead poisoning: protecting children from unsafe housing","OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of changes in Rhode Island's Lead Hazard Mitigation Law in 2005 on children's blood lead levels. METHODS: We used 2005 to 2009 data from Rhode Island's Lead Elimination Surveillance System; city tax assessor records in Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island; and records of conformance to the state's lead hazard mitigation law, to assess the extent to which legislation changes resulted in minimizing children's exposure to lead. RESULTS: During the 5-year study, the proportion of properties that complied with the new law increased for properties that housed young children. However, the majority of rental properties did not comply with the law. Children's lead levels declined by approximately 1 microgram per deciliter on average in properties that did comply, demonstrating that the law could have a protective effect for children. CONCLUSIONS: Legislation changes increased the proportion of properties that were certified as nonhazardous, leading to decreased blood lead levels for children living in these properties. However, legislation cannot be a highly effective primary prevention strategy if it does not cover all properties where children live and is not strictly enforced.","2014","Rhode Island","None","None"
"Primary prevention of lead poisoning in children: a cross-sectional study to evaluate state specific lead-based paint risk reduction laws in preventing lead poisoning in children","Background: Children younger than 72 months are most at risk of environmental exposure to lead from ingestion through normal mouthing behavior. Young children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than adults because lead is absorbed more readily in a child's gastrointestinal tract. Our focus in this study was to determine the extent to which state mandated lead laws have helped decrease the number of new cases of elevated blood-lead levels (EBLL) in homes where an index case had been identified. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare 682 residential addresses, identified between 2000 and 2009, in two states with and one state without laws to prevent childhood lead poisoning among children younger than 72 months, to determine whether the laws were effective in preventing subsequent cases of lead poisoning detected in residential addresses after the identification of an index case. In this study, childhood lead poisoning was defined as the blood lead level (BLL) that would have triggered an environmental investigation in the residence. The two states with lead laws, Massachusetts (MA) and Ohio (OH), had trigger levels of >= 25 mu g/dL and >= 15 mu g/dL respectively. In Mississippi (MS), the state without legislation, the trigger level was >= 15 mu g/dL. Results: The two states with lead laws, MA and OH, were 79% less likely than the one without legislation, MS, to have residential addresses with subsequent lead poisoning cases among children younger than 72 months, adjusted OR = 0.21, 95% CI (0.08-0.54).

Results of the regression analysis indicated that these combined variables were significant predictors (F[3,111] = 19.106, p < .05, R-2 = .341), accounting for 34.1% of the explained variance in the number elevated BLL cases. Number of houses built prior to 1980 (beta = .606, p < .05) and median household income (beta = -0.186, p < .05) were specifically revealed to be significant predictors of elevated blood lead cases.

"Spatial Distribution of Lead in Sacramento, California, USA","Chronic exposure to lead remains a health concern in many urban areas; Sacramento, California is one example, with state surveillance data showing nearly 3% of screened children reported with blood lead levels over 4.5 mu g/dL in 2009. To investigate the environmental exposure, 91 soil samples were collected and analyzed by ICP-AES and ICP-MS for 14 elements. An additional 28 samples were collected from areas of focus and analyzed by hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for Pb and Zn. Analysis of the metals data revealed non-normal distributions and positive skewness, consistent with anthropogenic input. In addition, high correlation coefficients (>= 0.75) of metal concentrations in Cd-Pb, Cd-Zn, Pb-Zn, and Sb-Sn pairs suggest similarities in the input mechanisms. Semivariograms generated from Pb and associated metals reveal these metals to exhibit spatial correlation. A prediction map of lead concentrations in soil was generated by ordinary kriging, showing elevated concentrations in soil located in the central, older area of Sacramento where historic traffic density and industrial activity have been historically concentrated. XRF analysis of Pb and Zn from additional samples verifies elevated concentrations in the central areas of Sacramento as predicted.","2015","California","None","None"
"Investigation of Childhood Lead Poisoning from Parental Take-Home Exposure from an Electronic Scrap Recycling Facility — Ohio, 2012","Lead affects the developing nervous system of children, and no safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. Elevated BLLs in childhood are associated with hyperactivity, attention problems, conduct problems, and impairment in cognition. Young children are at higher risk for environmental lead exposure from putting their hands or contaminated objects in their mouth. Although deteriorating lead paint in pre-1979 housing is the most common source of lead exposure in children, data indicate that ≥30% of children with elevated BLLs were exposed through a source other than paint. Take-home contamination occurs when lead dust is transferred from the workplace on employees' skin, clothing, shoes, and other personal items to their car and home. Recycling of used electronics (e-scrap) is a relatively recent source of exposure to developmental neurotoxicants, including lead. In 2010, the Cincinnati Health Department and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) investigated two cases of childhood lead poisoning in a single family. In 2012, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) learned about the lead poisonings during an evaluation of the e-scrap recycling facility where the father of the two children with lead poisoning worked. This report summarizes the case investigation. Pediatricians should ask about parents' occupations and hobbies that might involve lead when evaluating elevated BLLs in children, in routine lead screening questionnaires, and in evaluating children with signs or symptoms of lead exposure.","2015","Ohio","None","None"
"Lead Release to Drinking Water from Galvanized Steel Pipe Coatings","Problems identified with elevated lead in drinking water associated with galvanized steel pipes were recently hypothesized to result from lead accumulation on galvanized steel pipe surfaces from upstream lead service pipes. However, historical research documents that the grade of zinc typically used for galvanizing contains a minimum of 0.5% lead and can itself be a significant long-term source of lead, which may explain some recent lead contamination problems associated with galvanized steel. Surface analysis of various galvanized steel pipes and fittings installed from 1950 to 2008 demonstrated that the concentration of lead in the original zinc coating can range from nondetect to nearly 2%, dependent on the manufacturer and fitting type. Since cadmium is also present in many zinc coatings, but not in lead pipe, leaded solder, or brass, correlation of zinc concentration to both lead and cadmium concentrations in water was considered as a possible fingerprint implicating the coating on galvanized steel as a lead source; bench-scale tests of metal leaching from harvested galvanized steel pipes were used to validate this approach. Using profile sampling, individual homes with galvanized steel pipes as a primary lead source were identified in Washington, DC, Providence, RI, Chicago, IL, and a city in Florida. In some cases, the levels of lead from this source were very significant (>100 mu g/L) and can be exacerbated by installation of a copper pipe upstream during partial service line replacements.","2015","Florida","None","water"

Since cadmium is also present in many zinc coatings, but not in lead pipe, leaded solder, or brass, correlation of zinc concentration to both lead and cadmium concentrations in water was considered as a possible fingerprint implicating the coating on galvanized steel as a lead source; bench-scale tests of metal leaching from harvested galvanized steel pipes were used to validate this approach. Using profile sampling, individual homes with galvanized steel pipes as a primary lead source were identified in Washington, DC, Providence, RI, Chicago, IL, and a city in Florida.

"Incidence of waterborne lead in private drinking water systems in Virginia","Although recent studies suggest contamination by bacteria and nitrate in private drinking water systems is of increasing concern, data describing contaminants associated with the corrosion of onsite plumbing are scarce. This study reports on the analysis of 2,146 samples submitted by private system homeowners. Almost 20% of first draw samples submitted contained lead concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency action level of 15 μg/L, suggesting that corrosion may be a significant public health problem. Correlations between lead, copper, and zinc suggested brass components as a likely lead source, and dug/bored wells had significantly higher lead concentrations as compared to drilled wells. A random subset of samples selected to quantify particulate lead indicated that, on average, 47% of lead in the first draws was in the particulate form, although the occurrence was highly variable. While flushing the tap reduced lead below 15 μg/L for most systems, some systems experienced an increase, perhaps attributable to particulate lead or lead-bearing components upstream of the faucet (e.g., valves, pumps). Results suggest that without including a focus on private as well as municipal systems it will be very difficult to meet the existing national public health goal to eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children.","2015","Virginia","water","water"
"Elevated Blood Lead Levels Among Fire Assay Workers and Their Children in Alaska, 2010-2011","In October 2010, an employee at Facility A in Alaska that performs fire assay analysis, an industrial technique that uses lead-containing flux to obtain metals from pulverized rocks, was reported to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology (SOE) with an elevated blood lead level (BLL) ≥10 micrograms per deciliter (μg/dL). The SOE initiated an investigation; investigators interviewed employees, offered blood lead screening to employees and their families, and observed a visit to the industrial facility by the Alaska Occupational Safety and Health Section (AKOSH). Among the 15 employees with known work responsibilities, 12 had an elevated BLL at least once from October 2010 through February 2011. Of these 12 employees, 10 reported working in the fire assay room. Four children of employees had BLLs ≥5 μg/dL. Employees working in Facility A's fire assay room were likely exposed to lead at work and could have brought lead home. AKOSH inspectors reported that they could not share their consultative report with SOE investigators because of the confidentiality requirements of a federal regulation, which hampered Alaska SOE investigators from fully characterizing the lead exposure standards.","2015","Alaska","laboratory","laboratory"
"Revisiting Nonresidential Environmental Exposures and Childhood Lead Poisoning in the US: Findings from Kansas, 2000-2005","Although blood lead levels (BLLs) in US children have dramatically declined over the past 40 years, there remain pockets of children living in areas with elevated BLLs. While some increases (> or =10 mu g/dL) may be associated with legacy lead paint, ambient air lead may be contributing to the problem. A deidentified dataset of information on over 60,000 Kansas children under 3 years of age who were tested for BLL was provided through the Kansas Environmental Public Health Tracking Network for the period 2000-2005. Using ArcGIS, we calculated distance (in miles) from a lead-emitting industry referred to as a toxic release inventory (TRI) site. The USEPA TRI database tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health. US facilities in different industry sectors must report annually amount of substances like lead into the environment including their exact location. Distance from a TRI site was inversely related to BLL after controlling for area-level poverty and pre-1950 housing. The results of our evaluation indicate there is a significant relationship between proximity to lead industry and childhood BLLs. Proximity to sources of lead emissions should be evaluated as a possible factor when identifying children for targeted BLL testing.","2016","Kansas","None","air"
"Prevalence of Elevated Blood Lead Levels and Risk Factors Among Residents Younger Than 6 Years, Puerto Rico--2010","CONTEXT: Limited data exist about blood lead levels (BLLs) and potential exposures among children living in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has no formal blood lead surveillance program. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the prevalence of elevated BLLs (≥5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood), evaluated household environmental lead levels, and risk factors for BLL among children younger than 6 years of age living in Puerto Rico in 2010. METHODS: We used a population-based, cross-sectional sampling strategy to enroll an island-representative sample of Puerto Rican children younger than 6 years. We estimated the island-wide weighted prevalence of elevated BLLs and conducted bivariable and multivariable linear regression analyses to ascertain risk factors for elevated BLLs. RESULTS: The analytic data set included 355 households and 439 children younger than 6 years throughout Puerto Rico. The weighted geometric mean BLL of children younger than 6 years was 1.57 μg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.88). The weighted prevalence of children younger than 6 years with BLLs of 5 μg/dL or more was 3.18% (95% CI, 0.93-5.43) and for BLLs of 10 μg/dL or more was 0.50% (95% CI, 0-1.31). Higher mean BLLs were significantly associated with data collection during the summer months, a lead-related activity or hobby of anyone in the residence, and maternal education of less than 12 years. Few environmental lead hazards were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of elevated BLLs among Puerto Rican children younger than 6 years is comparable with the most recent (2007-2010) US national estimate (BLLs ≥5 μg/dL = 2.6% [95% CI = 1.6-4.0]). Our findings suggest that targeted screening of specific higher-risk groups of children younger than 6 years can replace island-wide or insurance-specific policies of mandatory blood lead testing in Puerto Rico.","2016","Puerto Rico","None","None"
"Evaluating the effectiveness of state specific lead-based paint hazard risk reduction laws in preventing recurring incidences of lead poisoning in children","Background: Despite significant progress made in recent decades in preventing childhood lead poisoning in the United States through the control or elimination of lead sources in the environment, it continues to be an issue in many communities, primarily in low-income communities with a large percentage of deteriorating housing built before the elimination of lead in residential paint. The purpose of this study is to determine whether state laws aimed at preventing childhood lead poisoning are also effective in preventing recurring lead poisoning among children previously poisoned. Methods: An evaluation was conducted to determine whether laws in two representative states, Massachusetts and Ohio, have been effective in preventing recurrent lead poisoning among children less than 72 months of age previously poisoned, compared to a representative state (Mississippi) which at the time of the study had yet to develop legislation to prevent childhood lead poisoning. Results: Compared to no legislation, unadjusted estimates showed children less than 72 months old, living in Massachusetts, previously identified as being lead poisoned, were 73% less likely to develop recurrent lead poisoning. However, this statistically significant association did not remain after controlling for other confounding variables. We did not find such a significant association when analyzing data from Ohio. Conclusions: While findings from unadjusted estimates indicated that state lead laws such as those in Massachusetts may be effective at preventing recurrent lead poisoning among young children, small numbers may have attenuated the power to obtain statistical significance during multivariate analysis. Our findings did not provide evidence that state lead laws, such as those in Ohio, were effective in preventing recurrent lead poisoning among young children.

"Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Associated With the Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Risk and Public Health Response","OBJECTIVES: We analyzed differences in pediatric elevated blood lead level incidence before and after Flint, Michigan, introduced a more corrosive water source into an aging water system without adequate corrosion control. METHODS: We reviewed blood lead levels for children younger than 5 years before (2013) and after (2015) water source change in Greater Flint, Michigan. We assessed the percentage of elevated blood lead levels in both time periods, and identified geographical locations through spatial analysis. RESULTS: Incidence of elevated blood lead levels increased from 2.4% to 4.9% (P < .05) after water source change, and neighborhoods with the highest water lead levels experienced a 6.6% increase. No significant change was seen outside the city. Geospatial analysis identified disadvantaged neighborhoods as having the greatest elevated blood lead level increases and informed response prioritization during the now-declared public health emergency. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels increased after water source change, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Water is a growing source of childhood lead exposure because of aging infrastructure.","2016","Michigan","None","water"
"Building the World That Kills Us: The Politics of Lead, Science, and Polluted Homes, 1970 to 2000","One of the most troubling urban health issues is childhood poisoning caused by lead, the widespread environmental toxin. It is in old plumbing fixtures, solder, paint and other building materials in huge quantities. Despite decades of improvements in blood lead levels among America's children, the continuing presence of lead on the walls of the nation's older houses and the known neurological effects of low-level exposures presents a classic problem: in light of the enormous costs of detoxifying the nation's housing, should society remove this toxin in order to prevent future impacts on IQ, attention deficits disorders, and possibly criminal behavior, or do we remove some of the most pernicious sources, such as window sashes and chipped paint to reduce, not eliminate, the risk to children? Throughout the 1970s and 1980s this issue emerged among public health advocates, HUD officials and housing reformers, and community organizers and activists. Who should bear the responsibility for polluted housing: Industry, housing officials, public health officials, landlords or tenants? The battles began during the 1960s and continue to today. In 2001 the high court in Maryland condemned studies conducted by Johns Hopkins researchers that sought to develop methods for the partial remediation of homes, saying they were akin to Nazi human experiments in which children were used as human guinea pigs. This article traces the evolving debate over responsibility for the public health consequences of polluted housing.","2016","Maryland","None","social"
"Children's Blood Lead Seasonality in Flint, Michigan (USA), and Soil-Sourced Lead Hazard Risks","In Flint; MI; USA; a public health crisis resulted from the switching of the water supply from Lake Huron to a more corrosive source from the Flint River in April 2014; which caused lead to leach from water lines. Between 2010 and 2015; Flint area children's average blood lead patterns display consistent peaks in the third quarter of the year. The third quarter blood lead peaks displayed a declining trend between 2010 and 2013; then rose abruptly between the third quarters of 2013 from 3.6% blood lead levels >= 5 mu g/dL to a peak of about 7% in the third quarter of 2014; an increase of approximately 50%. The percentage of blood lead level >= 5 mu g/dL in the first quarter of 2015 then dropped to 2.3%; which was the same percentage as the first quarter of 2014 (prior to the Flint River water source change). The Flint quarterly blood lead level peak then rose to about 6% blood lead levels >= 5 mu g/dL in the third quarter of 2015; and then declined to about 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Soil lead data collected by Edible Flint food collaborative reveal generally higher soil lead values in the metropolitan center for Flint; with lower values in the outskirts of the city. The questions that are not being asked is why did children's blood lead levels display a seasonal blood lead pattern before the introduction of the new water supply in Flint; and what are the implications of these seasonal blood lead patterns? Based upon previous findings in Detroit and other North American cities we infer that resuspension to the air of lead in the form of dust from lead contaminated soils in Flint appears to be a persistent contribution to lead exposure of Flint children even before the change in the water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River.","2016","Michigan","soil","soil"
"Multimedia exposures to arsenic and lead for children near an inactive mine tailings and smelter site","Children living near contaminated mining waste areas may have high exposures to metals from the environment. This study investigates whether exposure to arsenic and lead is higher in children in a community near a legacy mine and smelter site in Arizona compared to children in other parts of the United States and the relationship of that exposure to the site. Arsenic and lead were measured in residential soil, house dust, tap water, urine, and toenail samples from 70 children in 34 households up to 7 miles from the site. Soil and house dust were sieved, digested, and analyzed via ICP-MS. Tap water and urine were analyzed without digestion, while toenails were washed, digested and analyzed. Blood lead was analyzed by an independent, certified laboratory. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between each environmental media and urine and toenails for arsenic and lead. Geometric mean arsenic (standard deviation) concentrations for each matrix were: 22.1 (2.59) ppm and 12.4 (2.27) ppm for soil and house dust (<63 mu m), 5.71 (6.55) ppb for tap water, 14.0 (2.01) mu g/L for specific gravity-corrected total urinary arsenic, 0.543 (3.22) ppm for toenails. Soil and vacuumed dust lead concentrations were 16.9 (2.03) ppm and 21.6 (1.90) ppm. The majority of blood lead levels were below the limit of quantification. Arsenic and lead concentrations in soil and house dust decreased with distance from the site. Concentrations in soil, house dust, tap water, along with floor dust loading were significantly associated with toenail and urinary arsenic but not lead. Mixed models showed that soil and tap water best predicted urinary arsenic. In our study, despite being present in mine tailings at similar levels, internal lead exposure was not high, but arsenic exposure was of concern, particularly from soil and tap water. Naturally occurring sources may be an additional important contributor to exposures in certain legacy mining areas. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.","2016","Arizona","None","soil"

On January 2, 2015, a water advisory was issued because of detection of high levels of trihalomethanes, byproducts of disinfectants.(†)(,)(§) Studies conducted by local and national investigators detected an increase in the prevalence of blood lead levels (BLLs) ≥5 µg/dL (the CDC reference level) among children aged <5 years living in Flint (2) and an increase in water lead levels after the water source switch (3). On October 16, 2015, the Flint water source was switched back to DWA, and residents were instructed to use filtered tap water for cooking and drinking. During that time, pregnant and breastfeeding women and children aged <6 years were advised to consume bottled water.(¶) To assess the impact on BLLs of consuming contaminated drinking water, CDC examined the distribution of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL among children aged <6 years before, during, and after the switch in water source. This analysis enabled determination of whether the odds of having BLLs ≥5 µg/dL before the switch differed from the odds during the switch to FWS (before and after the January 2, 2015, water advisory was issued), and after the switch back to DWA. Overall, among 9,422 blood lead tests in children aged <6 years, 284 (3.0%) BLLs were ≥5 µg/dL during April 25, 2013-March 16, 2016. The adjusted probability of having BLLs ≥5 µg/dL was 46% higher during the period after the switch from DWA to FWS (and before the January 2, 2015, water advisory) than during the period before the water switch to FWS. Although unrelated to lead in the water, the water advisory likely reduced tap water consumption and increased consumption of bottled water. Characterizing exposure to lead contaminated drinking water among children aged <6 years living in Flint can help guide appropriate interventions.","2016","Michigan","None","water"
"The Impact of Low-Level Lead Toxicity on School Performance among Hispanic Subgroups in the Chicago Public Schools","BACKGROUND: Environmental lead exposure detrimentally affects children's educational performance, even at very low blood lead levels (BLLs). Among children in Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the severity of the effects of BLL on reading and math vary by racial subgroup (White vs. Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic Black). We investigated the impact of BLL on standardized test performance by Hispanic subgroup (Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic). METHODS: We examined 12,319 Hispanic children born in Chicago between 1994 and 1998 who were tested for BLL between birth and 2006 and enrolled in the 3rd grade at a CPS school between 2003 and 2006. We linked the Chicago birth registry, the Chicago Blood Lead Registry, and 3rd grade Illinois Standard Achievement Test (ISAT) scores to examine associations between BLL and school performance. Primary analyses were restricted to children with BLL below 10 µg/dL (0.483 µmol/L). RESULTS: BLLs below 10 µg/dL (0.483 µmol/L) were inversely associated with reading and math scores in all Hispanic subgroups. Adjusted Relative Risks (RRadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for reading and math failure were 1.34 (95% CI = 1.25, 1.63) and 1.53 (95% CI = 1.32, 1.78), respectively, per each additional 5 µg/dL of lead exposure for Hispanic children; RRadj did not differ across subgroups. We estimate that 7.0% (95% CI = 1.8, 11.9) of reading and 13.6% (95% CI = 7.7, 19.2) of math failure among Hispanic children can be attributed to exposure to BLLs of 5-9 µg/dL (0.242 to 0.435 µmol/L) vs. 0-4 µg/dL (0-0.193 µmol/L). The RRadj of math failure for each 5 µg/dL (0.242 µmol/L) increase in BLL was notably (p = 0.074) stronger among black Puerto Rican children (RRadj = 5.14; 95% CI = 1.65-15.94) compared to white Puerto Rican children (RRadj = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.12-2.02). CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood lead exposure is associated with poorer achievement on standardized reading and math tests in the 3rd grade for Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic children enrolled in Chicago Public Schools. While we did not see interactions between BLL and ISAT performance by Hispanic subgroup, the stronger association between BLL and math failure for Black Puerto Rican children is intriguing and warrants further study.","2016","Illinois","None","None"
"Blood Lead Levels in Young Children: US, 2009-2015","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate trends in blood lead levels in children <6 years of age, this Quest Diagnostics Health Trends report builds on previously reported National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data with a much larger national group and adds more detail and novel assessments. STUDY DESIGN: This report describes the results from a 6-year retrospective study (May 2009-April 2015) based on >5 million blood lead level results (including >3.8 million venous results) from children <6 years old living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We evaluated yearly changes and examined demographic categories including sex, pre-1950s housing construction, poverty income ratios (PIRs), Medicaid enrollment status, and geographic regions. RESULTS: Among children <6 years old, 3.0% exhibited blood lead levels ≥5.0 μg/dL (high). There were significant differences in high blood lead levels based on sex, pre-1950s housing construction quintiles, and PIR <1.25 and PIR >5 (all P < .01). Health and Human Services regions, states, and 3-digit ZIP code areas exhibited drastically different frequencies of high blood lead levels and blood lead levels ≥10.0 μg/dL (very high). Generally, levels declined over time for all groups. CONCLUSION: Examination of more than 5 million venous blood lead level results in children younger than 6 years old allowed for a robust, detailed analysis of blood lead level group results by geography and other criteria that are prohibited with the narrower National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. Progress in reducing the burden of lead toxicity is a public health success story that is incomplete with some identified factors posing larger, ongoing challenges.","2016","District of Columbia","None","None"
"Nature and extent of metal-contaminated soils in urban environments (keynote talk)","Research on the nature and extent of metal-contaminated soil began with an urban garden study in Baltimore, MD (USA). Largest quantities of soil metals were clustered in the inner city with lesser amounts scattered throughout metropolitan Baltimore. The probability values of metal clustering varied from P value 10(-15)-10(-23) depending on element. The inner-city clustering of lead (Pb) could not be explained by Pb-based paint alone. A major Pb source was tetraethyl lead (TEL), developed as an anti-knock agent for use in vehicle fuel, thereby making highway traffic flow a toxic substance delivery system in cities. Further study in Minneapolis and St. Paul confirmed the clustering of inner-city soil metals, especially Pb. Based on the evidence, the Minnesota State Legislature petitioned Congress to curtail Pb additives resulting in the rapid phasedown of TEL on January 1, 1986, 10 years ahead of the EPA scheduled ban. Further research in New Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA), verified the link between soil Pb, blood Pb, morbidity, and societal health. Although Pb is a known cause of clinical impairment, there is no known effective medical intervention for reducing children's blood Pb exposure. Ingestion and inhalation are routes of exposure requiring prevention, and soil is a reservoir of Pb. Children's blood Pb exposure observed in pre-Hurricane Katrina (August 29, 2005) NOLA underwent substantial decreases 10 years post-Katrina due to many factors including input of low Pb sediment residues by the storm surge and the introduction of low Pb landscaping materials from outside of the city. Investigation on the topic is ongoing.","2016","Louisiana","None","soil"
"Analysis of Pollution Hazard Intensity: A Spatial Epidemiology Case Study of Soil Pb Contamination","Heavy industrialization has resulted in the contamination of soil by metals from anthropogenic sources in Anniston, Alabama. This situation calls for increased public awareness of the soil contamination issue and better knowledge of the main factors contributing to the potential sources contaminating residential soil. The purpose of this spatial epidemiology research is to describe the effects of physical factors on the concentration of lead (Pb) in soil in Anniston AL, and to determine the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of those residing in areas with higher soil contamination. Spatial regression models are used to account for spatial dependencies using these explanatory variables. After accounting for covariates and multicollinearity, results of the analysis indicate that lead concentration in soils varies markedly in the vicinity of a specific foundry (Foundry A), and that proximity to railroads explained a significant amount of spatial variation in soil lead concentration. Moreover, elevated soil lead levels were identified as a concern in industrial sites, neighborhoods with a high density of old housing, a high percentage of African American population, and a low percent of occupied housing units. The use of spatial modelling allows for better identification of significant factors that are correlated with soil lead concentrations.","2016","Alabama","None","soil"
"Estimating Children's Soil/Dust Ingestion Rates through Retrospective Analyses of Blood Lead Biomonitoring from the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in Idaho","BACKGROUND: Soil/dust ingestion rates are important variables in assessing children's health risks in contaminated environments. Current estimates are based largely on soil tracer methodology, which is limited by analytical uncertainty, small sample size, and short study duration. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to estimate site-specific soil/dust ingestion rates through reevaluation of the lead absorption dose-response relationship using new bioavailability data from the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Site (BHSS) in Idaho, USA. METHODS: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in vitro bioavailability methodology was applied to archived BHSS soil and dust samples. Using age-specific biokinetic slope factors, we related bioavailable lead from these sources to children's blood lead levels (BLLs) monitored during cleanup from 1988 through 2002. Quantitative regression analyses and exposure assessment guidance were used to develop candidate soil/dust source partition scenarios estimating lead intake, allowing estimation of age-specific soil/dust ingestion rates. These ingestion rate and bioavailability estimates were simultaneously applied to the U.S. EPA Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children to determine those combinations best approximating observed BLLs. RESULTS: Absolute soil and house dust bioavailability averaged 33% (SD ± 4%) and 28% (SD ± 6%), respectively. Estimated BHSS age-specific soil/dust ingestion rates are 86-94 mg/day for 6-month- to 2-year-old children and 51-67 mg/day for 2- to 9-year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: Soil/dust ingestion rate estimates for 1- to 9-year-old children at the BHSS are lower than those commonly used in human health risk assessment. A substantial component of children's exposure comes from sources beyond the immediate home environment. CITATION: von Lindern I, Spalinger S, Stifelman ML, Stanek LW, Bartrem C. 2016.

"Associations between metals in residential environmental media and exposure biomarkers over time in infants living near a mining-impacted site","Infant exposures to metals are a concern for mining-impacted communities, although limited information is available to assess residential exposures over the first year of life. We measured lead (Pb), manganese, arsenic, and cadmium in indoor air, house dust, yard soil, and tap water from 53 infants' homes near the Tar Creek Superfund Site (Oklahoma, USA) at two time points representing developmental stages before and during initial ambulation (age 0-6 and 6-12 months). We measured infant metal biomarkers in: umbilical cord blood (n = 53); 12- (n = 43) and 24- (n = 22) month blood; and hair at age 12 months (n = 39). We evaluated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between infant residential and biomarker concentrations. A doubling of mean dust Pb concentration was consistently associated with 36-49% higher 12-month blood Pb adjusting for cord blood Pb (P <= 0.05). Adjusted dust concentration explained 29-35% of blood Pb variance, and consistent associations with other media were not observed. Although concentrations in dust and blood were generally low, strong and consistent associations between dust and body burden suggest that house dust in mining-impacted communities may impact children's health. These relationships were observed at a young age, typically before blood Pb levels peak and when children's development may be particularly vulnerable to toxic insult.","2016","Oklahoma","None","air"
"A Case Study of Environmental Injustice: The Failure in Flint","The failure by the city of Flint, Michigan to properly treat its municipal water system after a change in the source of water, has resulted in elevated lead levels in the city's water and an increase in city children's blood lead levels. Lead exposure in young children can lead to decrements in intelligence, development, behavior, attention and other neurological functions. This lack of ability to provide safe drinking water represents a failure to protect the public's health at various governmental levels. This article describes how the tragedy happened, how low-income and minority populations are at particularly high risk for lead exposure and environmental injustice, and ways that we can move forward to prevent childhood lead exposure and lead poisoning, as well as prevent future Flint-like exposure events from occurring. Control of the manufacture and use of toxic chemicals to prevent adverse exposure to these substances is also discussed. Environmental injustice occurred throughout the Flint water contamination incident and there are lessons we can all learn from this debacle to move forward in promoting environmental justice.","2016","Michigan","None","water"
"Behavioral and Environmental Explanations of Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Immigrant Children and Children of Immigrants","Immigrant/refugee children sometimes have substantially higher blood lead levels (BLLs) than US-born children in similar environments. We try to understand why, by exploring the relationship between immigration status of mother and the BLLs of US-born children. We compared BLLs of children born in Michigan to immigrant and non-immigrant parents, using the Michigan database of BLL tests for 2002-2005, which includes the child's race, Medicaid eligibility and address. We added census data on socio-demographic/housing characteristics of the child's block group, and information about parents. Low parental education, single parent households, mothers' smoking and drinking, all increase the child's BLL. However, immigrant parents had fewer characteristics associated with high BLL than US born parents, and their children had lower BLLs than children of US-born mothers. Our findings suggest that prior findings of higher BLLs among immigrant/refugee children probably result from them starting life in high-lead environments.","2016","Michigan","None","None"
"Soil Lead Testing at a High Spatial Resolution in an Urban Community Garden: A Case Study in Relic Lead in Terre Haute, Indiana","Industrial emissions, deteriorating or improperly removed lead paint, and the use of lead additives in fuel have left a substantial burden of heavy metals, such as lead, in urban soils. Much of this lead remains near the surface where it has the potential to impact human health. Exposure to lead, especially in children, can have lasting impacts on neurological development and academic achievement. Urban gardening, in particular, is an activity that could result in increased exposure to soil lead for many unsuspecting gardeners. During the summer of 2012, more than 1,061 surface soil samples were collected from an approximately 1.25 acre urban community garden in Terre Haute, Indiana. Samples were collected to evaluate the spatial distribution of lead across the community garden on the plot level. The results highlight the variability that can be seen within small areas of a former residential property, for example lead concentrations that are low (<200 parts per million [ppm]) within the same 10 x 10 foot garden plot as concentrations that are considered high (>600 ppm). Based on the results of this work, several areas of concern were identified and the community garden was reconfigured to reduce potential lead exposure to gardeners and the local community.","2016","Indiana","soil","soil"
"Assessment of blood lead level declines in an area of historical mining with a holistic remediation and abatement program","Lead exposure and blood lead levels (BLLs) in the United States have declined dramatically since the 1970s as many widespread lead uses have been discontinued. Large scale mining and mineral processing represents an additional localized source of potential lead exposure in many historical mining communities, such as Butte, Montana. After 25 years of ongoing remediation efforts and a residential metals abatement program that includes blood lead monitoring of Butte children, examination of blood lead trends offers a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of Butte's lead source and exposure reduction measures. This study examined BLL trends in Butte children ages 1-5 (n= 2796) from 2003-2010 as compared to a reference dataset matched for similar demographic characteristics over the same period. Blood lead differences across Butte during the same period are also examined. Findings are interpreted with respect to effectiveness of remediation and other factors potentially contributing to ongoing exposure concerns. REFERENCE POPULATION COMPARISON: BLLs from Butte were compared with a reference dataset (n=2937) derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The reference dataset was initially matched for child age and sample dates. Additional demographic factors associated with higher BLLs were then evaluated. Weights were applied to make the reference dataset more consistent with the Butte dataset for the three factors that were most disparate (poverty-to-income ratio, house age, and race/ethnicity). A weighted linear mixed regression model showed Butte geometric mean BLLs were higher than reference BLLs for 2003-2004 (3.48vs. 2.05µg/dL), 2005-2006 (2.65vs. 1.80µg/dL), and 2007-2008 (2.2vs. 1.72µg/dL), but comparable for 2009-2010 (1.53vs. 1.51µg/dL). This trend suggests that, over time, the impact of other factors that may be associated with Butte BLLs has been reduced. COMPARISON ACROSS BUTTE: Neighborhood differences were examined by dividing the Butte dataset into the older area called ""Uptown"", located at higher elevation atop historical mine workings, and ""the Flats"", at lower elevation and more recently developed. Significant declines in BLLs were observed over time in both areas, though Uptown had slightly higher BLLs than the Flats (2003-2004: 3.57vs. 3.45µg/dL, p=0.7; 2005-2006: 2.84vs. 2.52µg/dL, p=0.1; 2007-2008: 2.58vs. 1.99µg/dL, p=0.001; 2009-2010: 1.71vs. 1.44µg/dL, p=0.02). BLLs were higher when tested in summer/fall than in winter/spring for both neighborhoods, and statistically higher BLLs were found for children in Uptown living in properties built before 1940. Neighborhood differences and the persistence of a greater percentage of high BLLs (>5µg/dL) in Butte vs. the reference dataset support continuation of the home lead abatement program. CONCLUSIONS: Butte BLL declines likely reflect the cumulative effectiveness of screening efforts, community-wide remediation, and the ongoing metals abatement program in Butte in addition to other factors not accounted for by this study. As evidenced in Butte, abatement programs that include home evaluations and assistance in addressing multiple sources of lead exposure can be an important complement to community-wide soil remediation activities.","2016","Montana","None","None"
"High prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in both rural and urban Iowa newborns: Spatial patterns and area-level covariates","Lead in maternal blood can cross the placenta and result in elevated blood lead levels in newborns, potentially producing negative effects on neurocognitive function, particularly if combined with childhood lead exposure. Little research exists, however, into the burden of elevated blood lead levels in newborns, or the places and populations in which elevated lead levels are observed in newborns, particularly in rural settings. Using ~2300 dried bloods spots collected within 1-3 days of birth among Iowa newborns, linked with the area of mother's residence at the time of birth, we examine the spatial patterns of elevated (>5 μg/dL) blood lead levels and the ecological-level predictors of elevated blood lead levels. We find that one in five newborns exceed the 5 μg/dL action level set by the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Bayesian spatial zero inflated regression indicates that elevated blood lead in newborns is associated with areas of increased pre-1940s housing and childbearing-age women with low educational status in both rural and urban settings. No differences in blood lead levels or the proportion of children exceeding 5 μg/dL are observed between urban and rural maternal residence, though a spatial cluster of elevated blood lead is observed in rural counties. These characteristics can guide the recommendation for testing of infants at well-baby appointments in places where risk factors are present, potentially leading to earlier initiation of case management. The findings also suggest that rural populations are at as great of risk of elevated blood lead levels as are urban populations. Analysis of newborn dried blood spots is an important tool for lead poisoning surveillance in newborns and can direct public health efforts towards specific places and populations where lead testing and case management will have the greatest impact.","2017","Iowa","None","None"
"Interrupted time series analysis of children's blood lead levels: A case study of lead hazard control program in Syracuse, New York","Children's blood lead concentrations have been closely monitored over the last two decades in the United States. The bio-monitoring surveillance data collected in local agencies reflected the local temporal trends of children's blood lead levels (BLLs). However, the analysis and modeling of the long-term time series of BLLs have rarely been reported. We attempted to quantify the long-term trends of children's BLLs in the city of Syracuse, New York and evaluate the impacts of local lead poisoning prevention programs and Lead Hazard Control Program on reducing the children's BLLs. We applied interrupted time series analysis on the monthly time series of BLLs surveillance data and used ARMA (autoregressive and moving average) models to measure the average children's blood lead level shift and detect the seasonal pattern change. Our results showed that there were three intervention stages over the past 20 years to reduce children's BLLs in the city of Syracuse, NY. The average of children's BLLs was significantly decreased after the interventions, declining from 8.77μg/dL to 3.94μg/dL during1992 to 2011. The seasonal variation diminished over the past decade, but more short term influences were in the variation. The lead hazard control treatment intervention proved effective in reducing the children's blood lead levels in Syracuse, NY. Also, the reduction of the seasonal variation of children's BLLs reflected the impacts of the local lead-based paint mitigation program. The replacement of window and door was the major cost of lead house abatement. However, soil lead was not considered a major source of lead hazard in our analysis.","2017","New York","None","None"
"A geospatial analysis of soil lead concentrations around regional Oklahoma airports","Lead has been banned from automobile gasoline since 1995; however, lead is still used as an additive to aviation gasoline (avgas). Airports are now one of the greatest sources of lead air emission in the US. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate soil lead levels radially from three regional airports; (2) collect historical meteorological data; (3) examine the soil organic matter content and (4) develop correlation coefficients to evaluate correlations among variables. Soil samples were collected from 3 different airports in Oklahoma and the soil lead concentration was measured using x-ray fluorescence (XRF). The measured soil lead concentrations were plotted with the corresponding GPS location in ArcGIS and Inverse Distance Weight spatial analysis was used to create modeled isopleths of soil lead concentrations. One of the three airports was found to have soil lead concentrations that correlate with soil organic matter with one other showing correlation between soil lead concentration and distance from the airport. The spatial modeled isopleths showed elevated soil lead concentrations in the direction of prevailing winds with ""hot spots"" near the avgas fueling stations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Spatiotemporal exposome dynamics of soil lead and children's blood lead pre-and ten years post-Hurricane Katrina: Lead and other metals on public and private properties in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","Background: Anthropogenic re-distribution of lead (Pb) principally through its use in gasoline additives and lead-based paints have transformed the urban exposome. This unique study tracks urban-scale soil Pb (SPb) and blood Pb (BPb) responses of children living in public and private communities in New Orleans before and ten years after Hurricane Katrina (29 August 2005). Objectives: To compare and evaluate associations of pre- and ten years post-Katrina SPb and children's BPb on public and private residential census tracts in the core and outer areas of New Orleans, and to examine correlations between SPb and nine other soil metals. Methods: The Louisiana Healthy Housing and Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program BPb (mu g/dL) data from pre- (2000-2005) and post-Katrina (2010-2015) for <= 6-year-old children. Data from public and adjacent private residential census tracts within core and outer areas are stratified from a database that includes 916 and 922 SPb and 13,379 and 4830 BPb results, respectively, from pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. Statistical analyses utilize Multi-Response Permutation Procedure and Spearman's Rho Correlation. Results: Pre- to Post-Katrina median SPb decreases in public and private core census tracts were from 285 to 55 mg/kg and 710-291 mg/kg, respectively. In public and private outer census tracts the median SPb decreased from 109 to 56 mg/kg and 88-55 mg/kg. Children's BPb percent >= 5 mu g/dL on public and private core areas pre Katrina was 63.2% and 67.5%, and declined post-Katrina to 7.6% and 20.2%, respectively. BPb decreases also occurred in outer areas. Soil Pb is strongly correlated with other metals. Conclusions: Post-Katrina re-building of public housing plus landscaping amends the exposome and reduces children's BPb. Most importantly, Hurricane Katrina revealed that decreasing the toxicants in the soil exposome is an effective intervention for decreasing children's BPb.","2017","Louisiana","soil","soil"
"Assessing Child Lead Poisoning Case Ascertainment in the US, 1999-2010","ORTECTIVES: To compare prevalence estimates for blood lead level >= 10.0 mu g/dL (elevated blood lead level [EBLL]) with numbers reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children 12 months to 5 years of age from 1999 to 2010 on a state-by-state basis. METHODS: State-specific prevalence estimates were generated based on the continuous NHANES according to newly available statistical protocols. Counts of case reports were based on the 39 states (including the District of Columbia) reporting to the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program during the study period. Analyses were conducted both including and excluding states and years of nonreporting to the CDC. RESULTS: Approximately 1.2 million cases of EBLL are believed to have occurred in this period, but 607 000 (50%) were reported to the CDC. Including only states and years for which reporting was complete, the reporting rate was 64%. Pediatric care providers in 23 of 39 reporting states identified fewer than half of their children with EBLL. Although the greatest numbers of reported cases were from the Northeast and Midwest, the greatest numbers based on prevalence estimates occurred in the South. In southern and western states engaged in reporting, roughly 3 times as many children with EBLL were missed than were diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the best available estimates, undertesting of blood lead levels by pediatric care providers appears to be endemic in many states.","2017","District of Columbia","None","None"
"Social and Built Environmental Correlates of Predicted Blood Lead Levels in the Flint Water Crisis","OBJECTIVES: To highlight contextual factors tied to increased blood lead level (BLL) risk following the lead-in-water contamination in Flint, Michigan. METHODS: Using geocoded BLL data collected in 2013 and 2015 and areal interpolation, we predicted BLLs at every residential parcel in the city. We then spatially joined social and built environmental variables to link the parcels with neighborhood-level factors that may influence BLLs. RESULTS: When we compared levels before and during the water crisis, we saw the highest estimates of predicted BLLs during the water crisis and the greatest changes in BLLs in neighborhoods with the longest water residence time in pipes (μ = 2.30 µg/dL; Δ = 0.45 µg/dL), oldest house age (μ = 2.22 µg/dL; Δ = 0.37 µg/dL), and poorest average neighborhood housing condition (μ = 2.18 µg/dL; Δ = 0.44 µg/dL). CONCLUSIONS: Key social and built environmental variables correlate with BLL; such information can continue to guide response by prioritizing older, deteriorating neighborhoods with the longest water residence time in pipes.","2017","Michigan","social","water"
"High-Precision (MC-ICPMS) Isotope Ratio Analysis Reveals Contrasting Sources of Elevated Blood Lead Levels of an Adult with Retained Bullet Fragments, and of His Child, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Exposure to the neurotoxic element lead (Pb) continues to be a major human health concern, particularly for children in US urban settings, and the need for robust tools for assessment of exposure sources has never been greater. The latest generation of multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) instrumentation offers the capability of using Pb isotopic signatures as a tool for environmental source tracking in public health. We present a case where MC-ICPMS was applied to isotopically resolve Pb sources in human clinical samples. An adult male and his child residing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, presented to care in August 2015 with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) (>200 mu g/dL for the adult and 10 mu g/dL for the child). The adult subject is a gunshot victim who had multiple bullet fragments embedded in soft tissue of his thigh for approximately 10 years. This study compared the high-precision isotopic fingerprints (<1 % 2s external precision) of Pb in the adult's and child's whole blood (WB) to the following possible Pb sources: a surgically extracted bullet fragment, household paint samples and tap water, and a Pb water-distribution pipe removed from servicing a house in the same neighborhood. Pb in the bullet and adult WB were nearly isotopically indistin-guishable ( matching within 0.05-0.56%), indicating that bullet fragments embedded in soft tissue could be the cause of both acute and chronic elevated blood Pb levels.

"Blood Lead Concentrations of Children in the United States: A Comparison of States Using Two Very Large Databases","OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are substantial differences by state between 2 large datasets in the proportion of children with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs); to identify states in which the percentage of elevated BLLs is high in either or both datasets; and to compare the percentage of elevated BLLs in individual states with those of children living in Flint, Michigan, during the months when these children were exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water. STUDY DESIGN: Tables of BLLs for individual states from the Quest Diagnostics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention datasets for 2014-2015, containing more than 3 million BLLs of young children?<?6 years old, were constructed to compare the Quest Diagnostics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data with one another and with BLLs available for Flint children for 2014-2015. RESULTS: For some states, the percentages of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL are similar in the 2 datasets, whereas for other states, the datasets differ substantially in the percentage of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL. The percentage of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL is greater in some states in both datasets than observed in Flint when children were exposed to contaminated water. CONCLUSION: The data presented in this study can be a resource for pediatricians and public health professionals involved in the design of state programs to reduce lead exposure (primary prevention) and identify children with elevated BLLs (secondary prevention).","2017","Michigan","None","water"
"The Effect of Leaded Aviation Gasoline on Blood Lead in Children","Lead is a neurotoxin with developmentally harmful effects in children. In the United States, over half the current flow of lead into the atmosphere is attributable to lead-formulated aviation gasoline (avgas), used in a large fraction of piston-engine aircraft. Various public interest firms have petitioned the EPA to find endangerment from and regulate lead emitted by piston-engine aircraft, though the EPA has so far ruled against such petitions. To address an EPA request for more evidence, we construct a novel data set that links time and spatially referenced blood lead data from over a million children to 448 nearby airports in Michigan. Across a series of tests, and adjusting for other known sources of lead exposure, we find that child blood lead levels (1) increase dose-responsively in proximity to airports, (2) decline measurably among children sampled in the months after 9/11, (3) increase dose-responsively in the flow of piston-engine aircraft traffic, (4) increase in the percentage of prevailing wind days drifting in the direction of a child’s residential location, and (5) behave intuitively and significantly when considering two-way and three-way interactions of our main treatment variables. To quantify the policy relevance of the results we provide a conservative estimate of the social damages attributable to avgas consumption. Damages are at least $10 per gallon, which can be compared to a pump price of about $6 per gallon.","2017","Michigan","None","None"
"Relationship Between Total and Bioaccessible Lead on Children's Blood Lead Levels in Urban Residential Philadelphia Soils","Relationships between total soil or bioaccessible lead (Pb), measured using an in vitro bioaccessibility assay, and children's blood lead levels (BLL) were investigated in an urban neighborhood in Philadelphia, PA, with a history of soil Pb contamination. Soil samples from 38 homes were analyzed to determine whether accounting for the bioaccessible Pb fraction improves statistical relationships with children's BLLs. Total soil Pb concentration ranged from 58 to 2821 mg/kg; the bioaccessible Pb concentration ranged from 47 to 2567 mg/kg. Children's BLLs ranged from 0.3 to 9.8 μg/dL. Hierarchical models were used to compare relationships between total or bioaccessible Pb in soil and children's BLLs. Total soil Pb concentration as the predictor accounted for 23% of the variability in child BLL; bioaccessible soil Pb concentration as the predictor accounted for 26% of BLL variability. A bootstrapping analysis confirmed a significant increase in R(2) for the model using bioaccessible soil Pb concentration as the predictor with 99.0% of bootstraps showing a positive increase. Estimated increases of 1.3 μg/dL and 1.5 μg/dL in BLL per 1000 mg/kg Pb in soil were observed for this study area using total and bioaccessible Pb concentrations, respectively. Children's age did not contribute significantly to the prediction of BLLs.","2017","Pennsylvania","social","soil"

"Children's Lead Exposure: A Multimedia Modeling Analysis to Guide Public Health Decision-Making","BACKGROUND: Drinking water and other sources for lead are the subject of public health concerns around the Flint, Michigan, drinking water and East Chicago, Indiana, lead in soil crises. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC) recommended establishment of a ""health-based, household action level"" for lead in drinking water based on children's exposure. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to develop a coupled exposure-dose modeling approach that can be used to determine what drinking water lead concentrations keep children's blood lead levels (BLLs) below specified values, considering exposures from water, soil, dust, food, and air. Related objectives were to evaluate the coupled model estimates using real-world blood lead data, to quantify relative contributions by the various media, and to identify key model inputs. METHODS: A modeling approach using the EPA's Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS)-Multimedia and Integrated Exposure Uptake and Biokinetic (IEUBK) models was developed using available data. This analysis for the U.S. population of young children probabilistically simulated multimedia exposures and estimated relative contributions of media to BLLs across all population percentiles for several age groups. RESULTS: Modeled BLLs compared well with nationally representative BLLs (0-23% relative error). Analyses revealed relative importance of soil and dust ingestion exposure pathways and associated Pb intake rates; water ingestion was also a main pathway, especially for infants. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology advances scientific understanding of the relationship between lead concentrations in drinking water and BLLs in children.

"Examining Lead Exposures in California through State-Issued Health Alerts for Food Contamination and an Exposure-Based Candy Testing Program","In California, the annual number of children under age 6 y of age with blood lead levels (BLL) >= 10 mu g/dL is estimated at over 1,000 cases, and up to 10,000 cases when BLL between 4.5 and 9.5 mu g/dL are included. State-issued health alerts for food contamination provide one strategy for tracking sources of food-related lead exposures. As well, California passed legislation in 2006 for the Food and Drug Branch (FDB) of the state health department to test and identify lead in candy. This report presents health alert data from California over a 14-y period, compares data before and after the candy testing program began, and examines country of origin, ZIP code data, and time from candy testing to release of health alerts for lead-contaminated candies for 2011-2012. After 2007, health alerts issued for lead in candy and food increased significantly. Analysis of candy-testing data indicated that multiple counties and ZIP codes were affected. Seventeen candies with high lead concentrations were identified, resulting in rapid dissemination (<2 wk) of health alerts to local health departments and community clinicians and to the public. Surveillance of lead exposures from state-based food and candy testing programs provides an opportunity to identify and immediately act to remove nonpaint sources of lead affecting children.","2017","California","None","None"
"Predicting Blood-Lead Levels Among U.S. Children at the Census Tract Level","Efforts to prevent childhood lead exposure are hindered by difficulty in predicting where exposure is concentrated in the absence of childhood blood-lead data. To help fill that gap, we created and validated a regression model to estimate childhood lead exposure in every census tract in the United States. Publicly available factors that were the most predictive of childhood blood-lead concentration were identified by a literature review and an evaluation of childhood blood-lead level (BLL) records from a public health surveillance program in Michigan (543,295 records for the years 1999-2009). The predictive power of the regression model was validated through a comparison to blood-lead surveillance program data from Massachusetts (833,951 records for the years 2000-2009), Texas (838,368 records for the years 1999-2009), and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets. The regression model identified percentage of pre-1960 housing, percentage of population below poverty line, and percentage of population that is non-Hispanic black as the most predictive factors, with year, season, type of blood sample, and age of child as important covariates. The model based on Michigan data predicted geometric mean (GM) blood-lead concentrations within Michigan census tracts with an R2 of 0.69, in Massachusetts with an R2 of 0.28, and in Texas with an R2 of 0.20 and represents a substantial improvement over the application of the NHANES national estimate to predict local childhood BLLs. Applying the model for 1- and 2-year olds combined across the United States found that the nationally aggregated predictions matched the NHANES blood-lead distributions within 10% of the GM and within 10% of the 95th percentile of the national distributions.

"Burden of higher lead exposure in African-Americans starts in utero and persists into childhood","Background: Recent public health lead crises in urban areas emphasize the need to better understand exposure to environmental toxicants, particularly in higher risk groups. Although African-American children have the highest prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in the United States, little is known about when this trajectory of disproportionate burden of lead exposure first emerges. Objectives: Using tooth-matrix biomarkers that directly measure fetal and early childhood metal levels, the primary goal of this study was to determine if there were racial disparities in lead levels during fetal development and early childhood. Manganese, an essential nutrient that modifies the neurotoxic effects of lead, was also measured. Methods: Pregnant women served by the Henry Ford Health System and living in a predefined geographic area in and around Detroit, Michigan, were recruited during the second trimester or later into the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS), a population-based birth cohort. Offspring born between September 2003 and December 2007 were studied in childhood. Child race was parent-reported. Lead and manganese during the second and third trimesters, early postnatal life (birth through age 1 year) and early childhood (age 1 through time of tooth shedding, which ranges from 6 to 12 years) were measured via high-resolution microspatial mapping of dentin growth rings, a validated biomarker for prenatal and childhood metal exposure. Results: African-American children (N = 71) had 2.2 times higher lead levels in the second and third trimesters (both p < 0.001) and 1.9 times higher lead levels postnatally in the first year of life (p = 0.003) compared to white children (N = 51). Lead levels in African-American children were also higher during childhood, but this effect was only marginally significant (p = 0.066) and was attenuated after covariate adjustment. Additionally, we observed that African-American children had lower tooth-manganese levels during the third trimester (p = 0.063) and postnatally (p = 0.043), however these differences were attenuated after covariate adjustment. Conclusion: The disproportionate burden of lead exposure is vertically transmitted (i.e., mother-to-child) to African-American children before they are born and persists into early childhood. Our results suggest that testing women for lead during pregnancy (or in pre-conception planning), may be needed to identify the risk to their future offspring, particularly for African-American women.","2017","Michigan","None","None"

"Laboratory Screening for Children Entering Foster Care","OBJECTIVES:To determine the prevalence of medical illness detected by laboratory screening in children entering foster care in a single, urban county. METHODS:All children entering foster care in a single county in Ohio were seen at a consultation foster care clinic and had laboratory screening, including testing for infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis as well as for hemoglobin and lead levels. RESULTS:Over a 3-year period (2012-2015), laboratory screening was performed on 1977 subjects entering foster care in a consultative foster care clinic. The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis were all found to be <1%. There were no cases of HIV. Seven percent of teenagers entering foster care tested positive for Chlamydia. A secondary finding was that 54% of subjects were hepatitis B surface antibody-negative, indicating an absence of detected immunity to the hepatitis B virus. CONCLUSIONS:Routine laboratory screening for children entering foster care resulted in a low yield. Targeted, rather than routine, laboratory screening may be a more clinically meaningful approach for children entering foster care.","2017","Ohio","None","laboratory"
"Lead Emissions and Population Vulnerability in the Detroit (Michigan, USA) Metropolitan Area, 2006-2013: A Spatial and Temporal Analysis","Objective: The purpose of this research is to geographically model airborne lead emission concentrations and total lead deposition in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) from 2006 to 2013. Further, this study characterizes the racial and socioeconomic composition of recipient neighborhoods and estimates the potential for IQ (Intelligence Quotient) loss of children residing there. Methods: Lead emissions were modeled from emitting facilities in the DMA using AERMOD (American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate local racial residential segregation, controlling for poverty. Global Moran's I bivariate spatial autocorrelation statistics were used to assess modeled emissions with increasing segregation. Results: Lead emitting facilities were primarily located in, and moving to, highly black segregated neighborhoods regardless of poverty levels-a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. The findings from this research showed three years of elevated airborne emission concentrations in these neighborhoods to equate to a predicted 1.0 to 3.0 reduction in IQ points for children living there. Across the DMA there are many areas where annual lead deposition was substantially higher than recommended for aquatic (rivers, lakes, etc.) and terrestrial (forests, dunes, etc.) ecosystems. These lead levels result in decreased reproductive and growth rates in plants and animals, and neurological deficits in vertebrates. Conclusions: This lead-hazard and neighborhood context assessment will inform future childhood lead exposure studies and potential health consequences in the DMA.","2017","Michigan","None","None"

"Examining Public Perceptions about Lead in School Drinking Water: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Twitter Response to an Environmental Health Hazard","Exposure to lead has long been a community health concern in St. Louis, Missouri. The objective of this study was to examine public response to reports of elevated lead levels in school drinking water in St. Louis, Missouri via Twitter, a microblogging platform with over 320 million active users. We used a mixed-methods design to examine Twitter user status updates, known as tweets, from 18 August to 31 December 2016. The number of tweets each day was recorded, and Twitter users were classified into five user types (General Public, Journalist/News, Health Professional/Academic, Politician/Government Official, and Non-Governmental Organization). A total of 492 tweets were identified during the study period. The majority of discourse on Twitter occurred during the two-week period after initial media reports and was driven by members of the General Public. Thematic analysis of tweets revealed four themes: Information Sharing, Health Concerns, Sociodemographic Disparities, and Outrage. Twitter users characterized lead in school drinking water as an issue of environmental inequity. The findings of this study provide evidence that social media platforms can be utilized as valuable tools for public health researchers and practitioners to gauge public sentiment about environmental health issues, identify emerging community concerns, and inform future communication and research strategies regarding environmental health hazards.","2018","Missouri","water","water"
"Elevated Blood Lead Levels by Length of Time From Resettlement to Health Screening in Kentucky Refugee Children","OBJECTIVES: To examine elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in refugee children by postrelocation duration with control for several covariates. METHODS: We assessed EBLLs (≥ 5µg/dL) between 2012 and 2016 of children younger than 15 years (n = 1950) by the duration of resettlement to health screening by using logistic regression, with control for potential confounders (gender, region of birth, age of housing, and intestinal infestation) in a cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Prevalence of EBLLs was 11.2%. Length of time from resettlement to health screening was inversely associated with EBLLs (tertile 2 unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56, 1.12; tertile 3 OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42, 0.90; tertile 2 adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.97; tertile 3 AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.93). There was a significant interaction between intestinal infestation and age of housing (P < .003), indicating significant risk in the joint exposure of intestinal infestation (a pica proxy) and age of house. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood lead levels were reduced with increasing length of time of resettlement in unadjusted and adjusted models. Improved housing, early education, and effective safe-house inspections may be necessary to address EBLLs in refugees.","2018","Kentucky","None","None"
"Metal pollution investigation of Goldman Park, Middletown Ohio: Evidence for steel and coal pollution in a high child use setting","A geochemical investigation of both ballfield sediment and street sediment in a park adjacent to a major steel manufacturing site in Middletown, Ohio revealed Pb, Cu, Cr and Zn exceeded background levels, but in heterogeneous ways and in varying levels of health concern. Pb, Sn, and Zn had geoaccumulation values > 2 (moderate to heavy pollutants) in street sediment samples. Cr had a geoaccumulation value > 1, while Ni, W, Fe and Mn had geoaccumulation values between 1 and 0 in street sediment. Street sediment contamination factors for respective elements are Zn (10.41), Sn (5.45), Pb (4.70), Sb (3.45), Cr (3.19), W(2.59), and Mn (2.43). The notable elements with the highest factors for ball fields are Zn (1.72), Pb (1.36), Cr (0.99), V (0.95), and Mn (1.00). High correlation coefficients of known constituents of steel, such as Fe and Mo, Ni and Cr, W and Co, W and V, as well as particulate steel and coal spherule fragments found by SEM suggest probable sourcing of some of the metals from the AK Steel facility directly adjacent to the park. However, overall extensive heterogeneity of metal pollutants in the area points to the difficulties in sourcing pollutant metals, with many outside sources likely contributing as well. This study demonstrates that different sediment media can be impacted by significantly different metal pollutants even when in very close proximity to a single source and points to unrecognized complexity in urban pollution processes in the region. This study pertains to large-scale regional importance, as Middletown, Ohio is indicative of a typical post-industrial Midwestern U.S. city where limited investigation has been conducted regarding urban pollution and sourcing of materials.

"Universal Lead Screening Requirement: A California Case Study","Objectives. To estimate potential impacts of California Assembly Bill (AB) 1316: a requirement for universal screening and insurance coverage for child blood lead testing. Methods. In April 2017 the California Health Benefits Review Program (Oakland, CA) analyzed AB 1316 for the California legislature, including a systematic review of lead screening effectiveness, commercial insurer surveys regarding screening coverage, and actuarial utilization and cost implication assessments. Results. Universal screening requirements would increase child lead testing by 273%, raise affected populations' premiums by 0.0043%, and detect an additional 4777 exposed children 1 year after implementation. Conclusions. The evidence for a net societal benefit of universal screening approach is limited and is not supported by prominent medical professional groups. Public Health Implications.

However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms for water lead release in these systems. We evaluated water lead at the homes of two children with elevated blood lead in Macon County (North Carolina), which did not have identifiable lead paint or lead dust hazards, and examined water lead release patterns among 15 private wells in the county. Water lead release patterns differed among the 15 private wells. Problems with lead release were associated with (1) dissolution of lead from plumbing during periods of stagnation; (2) scouring of leaded scales and sediments during initial water use; and (3) mobilization of leaded scales during continued water use. Accurate quantification of water lead was highly dependent on sample collection methods, as flushing dramatically reduced detection of lead hazards. The incidence of high water lead in private wells may be present in other counties of North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States. The underestimation of water lead in wells may be masking cases of elevated blood lead levels attributed to this source and hindering opportunities to mitigate this exposure.","2018","Michigan","water","water"

"Smelting Remains a Public Health Risk Nearly a Century Later: A Case Study in Pueblo, Colorado, USA","Pueblo, Colorado has a long history of smelting activities, and recent studies raised concerns about lead exposure. This study tested 240 children in Pueblo for blood lead levels (BLLs) and found a significant association between distance from old smelters and children BLLs. Around 7.5% of Pueblo children had BLLs above the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 &micro;g/dL for elevated BLL, and 18.3% had BLLs between 3.3⁻4.9 &micro;g/dL. Out of the 36 children who lived near former smelters, 13.9% had BLLs above 5 &micro;g/dL vs. 6.37% for children living away from old smelters. The proportion of Pueblo children with elevated BLL was nearly three times the 2007⁻2010 United States national average (7.5% vs. 2.6%), and this was higher in the immediate vicinity of old smelters (13.9% vs. 2.6%). Genetic polymorphisms for ALAD-1 or ALAD-2 alleles, which play a role in susceptibility to lead toxicity, were not associated with children BBLs. Around 38.5% of houses sampled near the smelters had topsoil lead levels higher than the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s benchmark of 400 mg/kg. Our study resulted in the addition of areas of Pueblo to the EPA Superfund National Priorities List in December 2014, and cleanup is currently underway to minimize the public health risks.","2018","Colorado","None","None"
"Edible wild plants growing in contaminated floodplains: implications for the issuance of tribal consumption advisories within the Grand Lake watershed of northeastern Oklahoma, USA","Metal releases from the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) that is located in southwestern Missouri, southeastern Kansas, and northeastern Oklahoma, have contaminated floodplain soils within the Neosho and Spring river watersheds of the Grand Lake watershed. Since the Oklahoma portion of the watershed lies within ten tribal jurisdictions, the potential accumulation of metals within plant species that are gathered and consumed by tribal members, as well as the resulting metal exposure risks to tribal human health, was a warranted concern for further investigation. Within this study, a total of 36 plant species that are commonly consumed by tribes were collected from floodplain areas that were previously demonstrated to have elevated soil metal concentrations relative to reference sites. A significant, positive correlation was shown for metal concentrations in plant tissues versus soil (n = 258; Cd: R = 0.72, p = 0.00; Pb: R = 0.52, p = 0.00; and Zn: R = 0.70, p = 0.00). Additionally, a significant difference in metal concentration distributions existed between reference and impacted plant samples (n = 210, p = 0.00 for all metals). These results proved that floodplain soils are a major contamination pathway for metal accumulation within plants, and the source of metal contamination is the result of mining releases from the TSMD. Metal accumulation within plants was found to vary according to specific metal and plant species. The lowest dietary exposure out of all plant organs sampled were associated with fruit, whereas the highest was associated with roots, stem/leaves, and low-lying leafy greens. Metals in plants were compared to weekly dietary intake limits established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Based on specific serving sizes established within this study for tribal children and adults, many plant species had sufficient concentrations to warrant tribal consumption restrictions within the floodplains of Elm Creek, Grand Lake, Lost Creek, Spring River, and Tar Creek. Importantly, these results highlighted the necessity for the issuance of plant consumption advisories for tribal communities in the watershed. A consumption restriction guide on the number of allowable servings of each species per week at specific streams was developed within this study for tribal children and adults. Results also demonstrated that soil metal concentrations do not need to be exceptionally elevated relative to reference sites in order for plants to accumulate sufficient metal concentrations to exceed dietary limits for one serving. Therefore, the exposure risk associated with the consumption of plants cannot be accurately predicted solely from metal concentrations within soils, but must be based on metal concentrations within specific plant tissues on a site-by-site basis. A weekly consumption scenario was created within this study in order to better understand the potential metal dietary exposures to child and adult tribal members who consume multiple servings of multiple plant species per day, as well as benthic invertebrates and fish from the watershed. These findings demonstrated that plants pose a greater consumption exposure risk for tribal members than benthic invertebrates or fish. Therefore, without the consideration of exposure risks associated with the consumption of plants within future human health risk assessments, tribal health risks will be severely underestimated.","2018","Kansas","None","soil"

"Blood Lead Levels of Children in Flint, Michigan: 2006-2016","OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the increases in blood lead levels (BLLs) observed in young children in Flint, Michigan, during their exposure to corrosive Flint River water during the years 2014 and 2015 and compared their BLLs to those of Flint children measured during the years 2006-2013 and 2016. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study design using BLLs extracted from databases from 2006 to 2016. We analyzed a population sample of 15 817 BLLs from children aged ≤5 years with potential exposure to contaminated Flint River water. Percentages of BLLs ≥5.0 µg/dL and geometric mean (GM) BLLs were analyzed over time. RESULTS: A significant decline in the percentages of BLLs ≥5.0 µg/dL from 11.8% in 2006 to 3.2% in 2016 was observed (P < .001). GM ± SE BLLs decreased from 2.33 ± 0.04 µg/dL in 2006 to 1.15 ± 0.02 µg/dL in 2016 (P < .001). GM BLLs increased twice: from 1.75 ± 0.03 µg/dL to 1.87 ± 0.03 µg/dL (2010-2011) and from 1.19 ± 0.02 µg/dL to 1.30 ± 0.02 µg/dL (2014-2015). Overall, from 2006 to 2016, there was a 72.9% decrease in the percentage of children with BLLs ≥5.0 µg/dL and a 50.6% decrease in GM BLLs. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the 11 year trend of annual decreases in BLLs in children in Flint, Michigan, reversed to a degree consistent with random variation from 2010 to 2011, and again during the exposure to Flint River water in 2014-2015. Historically, public health efforts to reduce BLLs of young children in Flint have been effective over the 11-year period studied.","2018","Michigan","water","water"
"Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Buncombe County Children: Implications of Lowering the North Carolina Intervention Level to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Blood Lead Reference Value","Public health interventions in North Carolina were implemented only for children with blood lead levels (BLLs) >10 pg/dL until the end of the year in 2017, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established 5 pg/dL as a revised reference value for identifying children with elevated BLLs in 2012. This study quantified and characterized the children with elevated BLLs in Buncombe County, North Carolina. A review of case reports of Buncombe County children was conducted through the North Carolina Lead Surveillance System online database. In all, 23 children had confirmed elevated BLLs (>10 pg/dL) from 2005-2015, while 146 children had BLLs within 5 to <10 pg/dL from 20122015. Most of the identified children (62%) lived in Asheville and were 1-2 years old (65%). A significant number of children will be aided and prevented from further lead exposure since North Carolina has lowered the BLL intervention standard to the CDC reference value in 2012. The need for additional staffing at local health departments has been identified to adapt to such change.","2018","North Carolina","None","None"
"Evaluating Water Lead Levels During the Flint Water Crisis","In April 2014, the drinking water source in Flint, Michigan was switched from Lake Huron water with phosphate inhibitors to Flint River water without corrosion inhibitors. The absence of corrosion control and use of a more corrosive source increased lead leaching from plumbing. Our city-wide citizen science water lead results contradicted official claims that there was no problem- our 90th percentile was 26.8 mu g/L, which was almost double the Lead and Copper Rule action level of 15 mu g/L. Back calculations of a LCR sampling pool with 50% lead pipes indicated an estimated 90th percentile lead value of 31.7 mu g/L (+/- 4.3 mu g/L). Four subsequent sampling efforts were conducted to track reductions in water lead after the switch back to Lake Huron water and enhanced corrosion control. The incidence of water lead varied by service line material. Between August 2015 and November 2016, median water lead reduced from 3.0 to <1 mu g/L for homes with copper service lines, 7.2-1.9 mu g/L with galvanized service lines, and 9.9-2.3 mu g/L with lead service lines. As of summer 2017, our 90th percentile of 7.9 mu g/L no longer differed from official results, which indicated Flint's water lead levels were below the action level.","2018","Michigan","water","water"
"Effect of Residential Lead-Hazard Interventions on Childhood Blood Lead Concentrations and Neurobehavioral Outcomes: A Randomized Clinical Trial","IMPORTANCE: Childhood lead exposure is associated with neurobehavioral deficits. The effect of a residential lead hazard intervention on blood lead concentrations and neurobehavioral development remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a comprehensive residential lead-exposure reduction intervention completed during pregnancy could decrease residential dust lead loadings, prevent elevated blood lead concentrations, and improve childhood neurobehavioral outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal, community-based randomized clinical trial of pregnant women and their children, the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, was conducted between March 1, 2003, and January 31, 2006. Pregnant women attending 1 of 9 prenatal care clinics affiliated with 3 hospitals in the Cincinnati, Ohio, metropolitan area were recruited. Of the 1263 eligible women, 468 (37.0%) agreed to participate and 355 women (75.8%) were randomized in this intention-to-treat analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 interventions designed to reduce residential lead or injury hazards. Follow-up on children took place at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age. Data analysis was performed from September 2, 2017, to May 6, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Residential dust lead loadings were measured at baseline and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. At 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age, the children's blood lead concentrations as well as behavior, cognition, and executive functions were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 355 women randomized, 174 (49.0%) were assigned to the intervention group (mean [SD] age at delivery, 30.1 (5.5) years; 119 [68.3%] self-identified as non-Hispanic white) and 181 (50.9%) to the control group (mean [SD] age at delivery, 29.2 [5.7] years; 123 [67.9%] self-identified as non-Hispanic white). The intervention reduced the dust lead loadings for the floor (24%; 95% CI, -43% to 1%), windowsill (40%; 95% CI, -60% to -11%), and window trough (47%; 95% CI, -68% to -10%) surfaces. The intervention did not statistically significantly reduce childhood blood lead concentrations (-6%; 95% CI, -17% to 6%; P = .29). Neurobehavioral test scores were not statistically different between children in the intervention group than those in the control group except for a reduction in anxiety scores in the intervention group (β = -1.6; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.1; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Residential lead exposures, as well as blood lead concentrations in non-Hispanic black children, were reduced through a comprehensive lead-hazard intervention without elevating the lead body burden. However, this decrease did not result in substantive neurobehavioral improvements in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00129324.","2018","Ohio","None","None"
"A Comparison of Child Blood Lead Levels in Urban and Rural Children Ages 5-12 Years Living in the Border Region of El Paso, Texas","Lead exposure is an unresolved pediatric health risk and disproportionately affects children in lower-income neighborhoods. Residences with children younger than age 5 years are the focus of mitigation policies; however, studies have shown that older children between the ages of 5 and 12 years also are at risk of central nervous system effects. Whether historically contaminated neighborhoods present ongoing risk to older children also is of concern. This study compared the blood lead levels (BLLs) of older children from an historically contaminated urban neighborhood to those of demographically matched children from a nearby rural locale and predicted significantly higher BLLs in the urban children. The study included 222 children aged 5-12 years, 111 from the urban neighborhood and 111 from local rural townships, matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and family income. Blood lead, cadmium, and mercury were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. General linear models tested whether geographic location (urban vs. rural) predicted child heavy metal levels, controlling for sex and age. Only location predicted only child BLL (R(2)= 0.36); children living in the urban setting had significantly higher BLLs as compared with matched rural township children (F = 125, df(220,2), p <0.001). Neighborhoods with a history of lead contamination can present current risk of lead exposure for older children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as well as for infants and toddlers. More studies are needed to better characterize the risk of lead exposure to older children, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods with a history of lead contamination.","2018","Texas","None","None"
"Lead in Spices, Herbal Remedies, and Ceremonial Powders Sampled from Home Investigations for Children with Elevated Blood Lead Levels - North Carolina, 2011-2018","The number of pediatric cases of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) are decreasing in North Carolina. However, one county reported an increase in the number of children with confirmed BLLs ≥5 μg/dL (CDC reference value, https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm), from 27 in 2013 to 44 in 2017. Many children with elevated BLLs in this county lived in new housing, but samples of spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders from their homes contained high levels of lead. Children with chronic lead exposure might suffer developmental delays and behavioral problems (https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/). In 1978, lead was banned from house paint in the United States (1); however, children might consume spices and herbal remedies daily. To describe the problem of lead in spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders, the North Carolina Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (NCCLPPP) retrospectively examined properties where spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders were sampled that were investigated during January 2011-January 2018, in response to confirmed elevated BLLs among children. NCCLPPP identified 59 properties (6.0% of all 983 properties where home lead investigations had been conducted) that were investigated in response to elevated BLLs in 61 children. More than one fourth (28.8%) of the spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders sampled from these homes contained ≥1 mg/kg lead. NCCLPPP developed a survey to measure child-specific consumption of these products and record product details for reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lead contamination of spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders might represent an important route of childhood lead exposure, highlighting the need to increase product safety. Setting a national maximum allowable limit for lead in spices and herbal remedies might further reduce the risk for lead exposure from these substances.","2018","North Carolina","None","None"
"Occupational and Take-home Lead Exposure Among Lead Oxide Manufacturing Employees, North Carolina, 2016","OBJECTIVE: In 2016, North Carolina blood lead level (BLL) surveillance activities identified elevated BLLs among 3 children exposed to take-home lead by household members employed at a lead oxide manufacturing facility. We characterized BLLs among employees and associated children and identified risk factors for occupational and take-home lead exposure. METHODS: We reviewed BLL surveillance data for 2012-2016 to identify facility employees and associated children. We considered a BLL ≥5 μg/dL elevated for adults and children and compared adult BLLs with regulatory limits and recommended health-based thresholds. We also conducted an environmental investigation and interviewed current employees about exposure controls and cleanup procedures. RESULTS: During 2012-2016, 5 children associated with facility employees had a confirmed BLL ≥5 μg/dL. Among 77 people employed during 2012-2016, median BLLs increased from 22 μg/dL (range, 4-45 μg/dL) in 2012 to 37 μg/dL (range, 16-54 μg/dL) in 2016. All employee BLLs were <60 μg/dL, the national regulatory threshold for immediate medical removal from lead exposure; however, 55 (71%) had a BLL ≥20 μg/dL, a recommended health-based threshold for removal from lead exposure. Because of inadequate controls in the facility, areas considered clean were visibly contaminated with lead dust. Employees reported bringing personal items to work and then into their cars and homes, resulting in take-home lead exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of child and adult BLL surveillance activities identified an occupational source of lead exposure among workers and associated children. Our findings support recent recommendations that implementation of updated lead standards will support better control of lead in the workplace and prevent lead from being carried home.","2018","North Carolina","None","social"
"Preliminary assessment of lead concentrations in topsoil of 100 parks in Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles has a long history of lead (Pb) contamination due to automobile emissions, industrial processes, and Pb-containing paint. Although the amount of Pb coming from these sources has been reduced or eliminated, exposure to Pb-contaminated soil is still a concern. Contaminated soil in urban parks may constitute an important exposure route, since children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Pb. While the current EPA clean up level is 400 parts per million (ppm) in recreational and residential areas, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of California revised the soil-screening level to 80 ppm, based on a 1 mu g/dL increase of blood level that children experience. In this work, top soil samples in triplicate were taken from each of 100 urban parks in Los Angeles and analyzed to determine Pb concentrations and soil properties. Results show that the average Pb concentration in park soil was 65.5 ppm (range: 0.969-363 ppm), with 35 parks exceeding the California guideline of 80 ppm based on the average Pb concentration measured at each park. Pb concentrations in 42 parks exceeded the background value of 19.7 ppm (by a factor of 3-17). However, variation in measured levels of Pb within most parks was high ( > 10% RSD in 89 parks). Parks containing elevated Pb concentrations in soil were distributed across many areas of Los Angeles, including central Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, and Central Alameda. Children might potentially suffer from an estimated 1-4 mu g/dL increase of blood Pb level according to LeadSpread model. Pb concentrations did not significantly correlate with most soil properties, except for silt (rho = 0.226, p = 0.012). Additionally, soil from sandy loam contained significantly higher Pb concentrations as compared to soil from loamy sand (p = 0.008). Pb concentrations were significantly correlated with park age (rho = - 0.319, p = 0.033) and were generally lower in areas located away from major roads. Monitoring of parks with high levels of Pb as well as investigation of unexamined regions in Los Angeles are needed.","2018","California","None","soil"
"The State of Public Health Lead Policies: Implications for Urban Health Inequities and Recommendations for Health Equity","Although lead has been removed from paint and gasoline sold in the U.S., lead exposures persist, with communities of color and residents in urban and low-income areas at greatest risk for exposure. The persistence of and inequities in lead exposures raise questions about the scope and implementation of policies that address lead as a public health concern. To understand the multi-level nature of lead policies, this paper and case study reviews lead policies at the national level, for the state of California, and for Santa Ana, CA, a dense urban city in Southern California. Through a community-academic partnership process, this analysis examines lead exposure pathways represented, the level of intervention (e.g., prevention, remediation), and whether policies address health inequities. Results indicate that most national and state policies focus on establishing hazardous lead exposure levels in settings and consumer products, disclosing lead hazards, and remediating lead paint. Several policies focus on mitigating exposures rather than primary prevention. The persistence of lead exposures indicates the need to identify sustainable solutions to prevent lead exposures in the first place. We close with recommendations to reduce lead exposures across the life course, consider multiple lead exposure pathways, and reduce and eliminate health inequities related to lead.","2019","California","None","None"
"Assessment of Child Lead Exposure in a Philadelphia Community, 2014","INTRODUCTION: Several urban neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have a history of soil, household lead paint, and potential lead-emitting industry contamination. OBJECTIVES: To (1) describe blood lead levels (BLLs) in target neighborhoods, (2) identify risk factors and sources of lead exposure, (3) describe household environmental lead levels, and (4) compare results with existing data. METHODS: A simple, random, cross-sectional sampling strategy was used to enroll children 8 years or younger living in selected Philadelphia neighborhoods with a history of lead-emitting industry during July 2014. Geometric mean of child BLLs and prevalence of BLLs of 5 μg/dL or more were calculated. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to ascertain risk factors for elevated BLLs. RESULTS: Among 104 children tested for blood lead, 13 (12.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5-20.2) had BLLs of 5 μg/dL or more. The geometric mean BLL was 2.0 μg/dL (95% CI, 1.7-2.3 μg/dL). Higher geometric mean BLLs were significantly associated with front door entryway dust lead content, residence built prior to 1900, and a child currently or ever receiving Medicaid. Seventy-one percent of households exceeded the screening level for soil, 25% had an elevated front door floor dust lead level, 28% had an elevated child play area floor dust lead level, and 14% had an elevated interior window dust lead level. Children in households with 2 to 3 elevated environmental lead samples were more likely to have BLLs of 5 μg/dL or more. A spatial relationship between household proximity to historic lead-emitting facilities and child BLL was not identified. CONCLUSION: Entryway floor dust lead levels were strongly associated with blood lead levels in participants. Results underscore the importance to make housing lead safe by addressing all lead hazards in and around the home. Reduction of child lead exposure is crucial, and continued blood lead surveillance, testing, and inspection of homes of children with BLLs of 5 μg/dL or more to identify and control lead sources are recommended. Pediatric health care providers can be especially vigilant screening Medicaid-eligible/enrolled children and children living in very old housing.","2019","Pennsylvania","None","soil"
"Drinking water lead and socioeconomic factors as predictors of blood lead levels in New Jersey's children between two time periods","As blood lead levels have decreased over time, the relative contributions of alternative lead sources warrant further examination. Much attention has been paid to the relative contribution of lead in drinking water, particularly after the discovery of contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan which has also renewed interest in the persistent socioeconomic and racial disparities in children's exposure to lead. As the environmental sources of lead exposure are shifting in importance over time, we decided to examine how demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors may confound or interact with each other, and whether these relationships have changed over time. The study population included all New Jersey resident children aged 6-26 months with at least one blood lead specimen collected between 2000 and 2004 (n = 288,758) or 2010 and 2014 (n = 326,530). Reported 90th percentile water lead data (in parts per billion) was summarized annually for each water system statewide. Children's blood lead levels have decreased over time from a statewide geometric mean of 2.47 µg/dL (95% CI 2.46, 2.48) between 2000 and 2004 to 1.57 µg/dL (95% CI 1.57, 1.57) between 2010 and 2014. Individual-level factors of child's age and season of blood draw and area-based measures of race, older housing, and poverty were predictors of children's blood lead levels. Conclusions regarding area-based measure of Hispanic ethnicity are limited and require further research. The narrow range and low levels of area-based lead concentrations in drinking water limits the ability to detect associations with blood lead levels. Racial disparities in blood lead continue to persist but economic disparities may be narrowing as blood lead concentrations continue to decline.","2019","New Jersey","water","water"
"Explaining variation in elevated blood lead levels among children in Minnesota using neighborhood socioeconomic variables","BACKGROUND: Childhood lead exposure is linked to numerous adverse health effects and exposure in the United States is highest among people living in substandard housing, which is disproportionately inhabited by socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. In this paper, we compared the Vox lead exposure risk score and concentrated disadvantage based on principal component analysis (PCA) to weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to determine which method was best able to explain variation in elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs). METHODS: We constructed indices for census tracts in Minnesota and used them in Poisson regression models to identify the best socioeconomic measure for explaining EBLL risk. RESULTS: All indices had a significant association with EBLL in separate models. The WQS index had the best goodness-of-fit, followed next by the Vox index, and then the concentrated disadvantage index. Among the most important variables in the WQS index were percent of houses built before 1940, percent renter occupied housing, percent unemployed, and percent African American population. CONCLUSIONS: The WQS approach was best able to explain variation in EBLL risk and identify census tracts where targeted interventions should be focused to reduce lead exposure.","2019","Minnesota","None","None"
"Inconsistent screening for lead endangers vulnerable children: policy lessons from South Bend and Saint Joseph County, Indiana, USA","Lead exposure is a major health hazard affecting children and their growth and is a concern in many urban areas around the world. One such city in the United States (US), South Bend Indiana, gained attention for its high levels of lead in blood and relatively low testing rates for children. We assessed current lead screening practices in South Bend and the surrounding St. Joseph County (SJC). The 2005-2015 lead screening data included 18,526 unique children. Lead screening rates ranged from 4.7 to 16.7%. More than 75% of children had 'elevated blood lead levels' (EBLL) ≥ 1 micrograms per deciliter (µg/Dl) and 9.7% had an EBLL ≥ 5 μg/dL. Over 65% of the census tracts in SJC had mean EBLL ≥ 5 μg/dL, suggesting widespread risk. Inconsistent lead screening rates, coupled with environmental and societal risk factors, put children in SJC at greater risk for harmful lead exposure than children living in states with provisions for universal screening. Indiana and other states should adhere to the US Centers for Disease Control's guideline and use universal lead testing to protect vulnerable populations.","2019","Indiana","None","None"
"Reduction in the Lead Content of Candy and Purses in California Following Successful Litigation","Lead exposure causes an array of significant health problems in adults and especially in children. Therefore, reducing lead exposure is an important public health goal. Here, we analyzed data collected about the lead content in two product types, candy and purses. We show that following litigation, the prevalence of these products containing lead in California declined significantly. Results from products purchased online suggest that the decline was national, not just limited to California. Our results indicate that state consumer protection laws can be successful in reducing exposure to hazardous chemicals.","2019","California","None","None"
"POU water filters effectively reduce lead in drinking water: a demonstration field study in flint, Michigan","A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of faucet-mounted point of use (POU) water filters for removing high concentrations of lead in drinking water from premise plumbing sources and lead service lines (LSL). These filters were concurrently certified for total lead removal under NSF/ANSI Standard 53 (NSF/ANSI-53) and for fine particulate (Class I) reduction under NSF/ANSI Standard 42 (NSF/ANSI-42). In 2016, filtered and unfiltered drinking water samples were collected at over 345 locations in Flint, Michigan. Over 97% of filtered water samples contained lead below 0.5 mu g/L. The maximum lead concentration in filtered water was 2.9 mu g/L, well below the bottled water standard. The effectiveness of the POU activated carbon block filters in reducing lead concentrations, even above the 150 mu g/L NSF/ANSI-53 challenge standard, is likely related to trapping particles due to the small effective pore size of the filters, in addition to ion-exchange or sorption removal of soluble lead. Properly installed and maintained POU filters, certified under both NSF/ANSI-53 (for total lead) and NSF/ANSI-42 (for fine particulate), can protect all populations, including pregnant women and children, by reducing lead in drinking water to levels that would not result in a significant increase in overall lead exposure.","2019","Michigan","None","water"
"Cost-benefit of point-of-use devices for lead reduction","Background: Lead exposure represents a significant human health concern that often occurs with little warning to the consumer. Water lead levels can be mitigated by point-of-use (POU) devices such as reverse osmosis, distillation, or activated carbon with lead reduction media. Objectives: This study assessed a partial cost-benefit of residential installation of POU devices to reduce lead concentrations in drinking water and examined the economic impact at the community level based on exposures reported in Flint, Michigan. Methods: We calculated the individual consumer breakeven point for each lead abatement option by subtracting the lifetime cost of device installation and maintenance from the lifetime cost of lead exposure through its impact on intelligence (IQ) and lifetime earnings. This approach was then extrapolated to the community level based on reported lead exposures in Flint, Michigan. Results: Based on operating POU device costs, lead absorption from water, and economic losses associated with reduced IQ, initial water lead levels associated with consumer breakeven points for reverse osmosis (7.31 mu g/L), activated carbon (3.73 mu g/L), and distillation (12.0 mu g/L) were calculated. For example, an individual consuming water with 25 mu g/L of lead, similar to the 90th percentile of concentrations measured in Flint, Michigan, would have an expected blood lead level of 1.25 mu g/dL, a corresponding loss of 0.641 IQ points, and a lifetime economic earnings loss of $14,284. Over 70 years of continued use, activated carbon with lead reduction media is the least expensive device to maintain and operate as compared to reverse osmosis and distillation. Conclusions: Infrastructure failures related to drinking water are unpredictable and exposure to contaminates can have significant economic ramifications. POU devices represent a cost-effective option to reduce the impact of lead exposure, particularly when water lead concentrations exceed regulated levels.","2019","Michigan","None","water"
"Lead Poisoning in Private and Public Housing: The Legacy Still Before Us","Public health professionals and allies have long fought to eliminate and control the exposures that have come with increased global lead production (Figure 1). But unless new action is taken, history demonstrates that additional cases ofelevated blood lead levels can be expected, despite the overwhelming evidence that interventions are effective. Indeed, the global disease burden from lead increased by 160% between 1990 and 2010 and accounts for 674 000 deaths and 14 million disability-adjusted life years.1This issue of AJPH contains two important new contributions to the lead poisoning prevention literature (pages 906 and 912). Together, these articles demonstrate that public perceptions about the problem can be at odds with the scientific evidence. More important, however, they show that concerted public actions can succeed when they are implemented and enforced.All too often, the public views lead exposure as a ""legacy"" problem that has already been solved by earlier actions to remove lead from new paint, gasoline, cosmetics, food canning, and other products. Lead exposure is sometimes perceived to be a problem for only a few places where something unusual happened, such as Flint, Michigan, when the evidence clearly shows the problem is far more widespread.","2019","Michigan","None","None"
"Elevated Blood Lead Levels Among Resettled Refugee Children in Ohio, 2009-2016","Objectives. To assess the prevalence of and the demographic factors for elevated blood lead level (EBLL; ≥ 5 µg/dL) at resettlement among newly admitted refugee children. Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the postresettlement refugee medical screening of 5661 children resettled in Ohio from 2009 to 2016. We computed prevalence of EBLL and adjusted prevalence ratio with modified Poisson regression modeling. Results. Overall, 22.3% of children younger than 18 years and 27.1% of those younger than 6 years had an EBLL. Children resettled from a South Asia region including Afghanistan (EBLL prevalence = 56.2%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 48.1%, 64.3%), Nepal (44.0%; 95% CI = 33.7%, 54.1%), Bhutan (32.8%; 95% CI = 30.4%, 35.9%), and Burma (31.8%; 95% CI = 27.5%, 35.9%) had the highest prevalence of EBLLs. In addition, those younger than 6 years (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.6, 2.6), male (PR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.4), and screened within 30 days of arrival (PR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1, 2.5) had significantly higher EBLL prevalence than did children aged 13 years and older, female, and screened 90 days after arrival. Conclusions. The overall high proportion of EBLL and variation in EBLL by country of origin among resettled refugee children in the United States warrant comprehensive, yet tailored, guidelines for health professionals and resettlement and government agencies for better prevention and awareness programs targeting these high-risk children.","2019","Ohio","None","None"
"Compliance With Mandated Testing for Lead in Drinking Water in School Districts in New Jersey","Preventing lead exposure from all sources is critical for children's optimal health and development. The crisis in Flint, Michigan, drew attention to the role of drinking water in lead exposure. School drinking water might pose significant risks due to aging infrastructure and the particular conditions of water use in schools. In 2016, New Jersey mandated that school districts test all drinking water outlets for lead and specified procedures that districts must follow. This study assessed compliance with this mandate. Districts were required to report results on their websites, so we used district websites as the unit of analysis to assess compliance with testing and reporting procedures and to identify schools that had reported maximum concentrations of lead in water. Most districts complied with the mandate to test their drinking water (90%) and the majority complied with online reporting requirements to some extent (87%). Most districts (79%) had one or more outlets in their district that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 15 ppb. Mandated testing for lead in drinking water in schools is an important policy that can prevent childhood lead exposure.

"First trimester maternal exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals and fetal size in the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs study","Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals are near ubiquitous worldwide, and their potential impact on children is a major public health concern. This pilot study was designed to characterize exposures to phthalates, phenols and metals among pregnant women in the first trimester, and to examine associations with fetal biometrics and birth weight. A total of 41 chemicals and elements were analyzed in urine from 56 mothers with full-term newborns from the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs study. Bivariate analyses identified predictors of exposure biomarkers. Associations between birth weight, Fenton z-scores and second trimester fetal biometrics with toxicants were examined via multivariable linear regression. An average of 30 toxicants were detected in maternal urine. Fast food consumption was associated with several phthalate metabolites, phenols and metals, and canned food consumption with bisphenol F (P <0.05). Mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate was significantly associated with higher birth weight and Fenton z-score while the opposite was observed for bisphenol S. Estimated femur length from ultrasonography was significantly inversely associated with arsenic, barium and lead. While limited by sample size, this study is one of the first to evaluate birth outcomes with respect to emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals and to examine associations between toxicants and fetal biometrics. Exposure assessment was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (NIEHS CHEAR), a resource available to children's studies with the goal of combining data across cohorts in an effort to characterize the impact of toxicants on child health from birth and beyond.","2019","Michigan","None","None"
"Using Birth Cohort Data to Estimate Prenatal Chemical Exposures for All Births around the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site in Massachusetts","Background: Children born near New Bedford, Massachusetts, have been prenatally exposed to multiple environmental chemicals, in part due to an older housing stock, maternal diet, and proximity to the New Bedford Harbor (NBH) Superfund site. Chemical exposure measures are not available for all births, limiting epidemiologic investigations and potential interventions. Objective: We linked biomonitoring data from the New Bedford Cohort (NBC) and birth record data to predict prenatal exposures for all contemporaneous area births. Methods: We used prenatal exposure biomarker data from the NBC, a population-based cohort of 788 mother–infant pairs born during 1993–1998 to mothers living near the NBH, linked to their corresponding Massachusetts birth record data, to build predictive models for cord serum polychlorinated biphenyls (expressed as a sum,ΣPCBs ), p , p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), cord blood lead (Pb), and maternal hair mercury (Hg). We applied the best fit models (highest pseudo R 2 ), with multivariable smooths of continuous variables, to predict exposure biomarkers for all 10,270 births during 1993–1998 around the NBH. We used 10-fold cross validation to validate the exposure models and the bootstrap method to characterize sampling variability in the exposure predictions. Results: The 10-fold cross-validated R 2 for theΣPCBs , DDE, HCB, Pb, and Hg exposure models were 0.54, 0.40, 0.34, 0.46, and 0.40, respectively. For each exposure model, multivariable smooths of continuous variables improved the fit compared with linear models. Other variables with significant effects on exposure estimates were paternal education, maternal race/ethnicity, and maternal ancestry. The resulting exposure predictions for all births had variability consistent with the NBC measured exposures. Conclusions: Predictive models using multivariable smoothing explained reasonable amounts of variance in prenatal exposure biomarkers. Our analyses suggest that prenatal chemical exposures can be predicted for all contemporaneous births in the same geographic area by modeling available biomarker data for a subset of that population.","2019","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Understanding lead in water and avoidance strategies: a United States perspective for informed decision-making","The pervasiveness of lead in drinking water poses a significant public health threat, which can be reduced by implementing preventive measures. However, the causes of elevated lead in water and the benefits of lead in water avoidance strategies are often misunderstood. Based on experiences in the United States, this paper describes an oversimplified 'lead in water equation' to explain key variables controlling the presence of lead in drinking water to better inform public health practitioners, government officials, utility personnel, and concerned residents. We illustrate the application of the equation in Flint, Michigan and explore the primary household-level water lead avoidance strategies recommended during the crisis, including flushing, filtration, bottled water use, and lead pipe removal. In addition to lead reduction, strategies are evaluated based on costs and limitations. While these lead avoidance strategies will reduce water lead to some degree, the costs, limitations, and effectiveness of these strategies will be site- and event-specific. This paper presents a simplified approach to communicate key factors which must be considered to effectively reduce waterborne lead exposures for a wide range of decision makers.","2019","Michigan","water","water"

Our results show the probability of EBLL was spatially structured with high values in Baltimore city and low values in the District of Columbia suburbs and Baltimore suburbs. The association between the neighborhood deprivation index and EBLL risk was statistically significant after accounting for spatial dependence in probability of EBLL. The percent of houses built before 1940, African Americans, and renter occupied housing were the most important variables in the index.

"Analysis of blood lead levels of young children in Flint, Michigan before and during the 18-month switch to Flint River water","Background: The toxicity of lead, like any xenobiotic, is directly linked to the duration of exposure and toxin concentration in the body. The elevation in blood lead levels (BLLs) in young Flint, Michigan children noted in time-periods before, and during the 18-month exposure to Flint River water (FRW) from 25 April 2014 to 15 October 2015 is well-known internationally. The length of time BLLs were elevated is unknown, yet key in understanding the potential health impact of the event. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether BLLs in Flint children were increased during the entire 18-month FRW exposure compared to similar earlier time periods. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study analyzing BLLs from Flint children aged 5 years and under. The geometric mean (GM) BLLs and percentages of BLLs ≥5.0 μg/dL in Period I: 25 April 2006 to 15 October 2007 (earliest timeframe available for study) and Period II: 25 April 2012 to 15 October 2013 (timeframe immediately before the water switch), were compared to Period III, 25 April 2014 to 15 October 2015 (FRW exposure). Results: There were 5663 BLLs available for study. GM ± SE BLLs decreased from 2.19 ± 0.03 μg/dL in Period I to 1.47 ± 0.02 μg/dL in Period II [95% CI, 0.64, 0.79]; p<.001 and decreased further to 1.32 ± 0.02 µg/dL during the FRW Period III [95% CI, 0.79, 0.95]; p<.001. The percentage of BLLs ≥5.0 μg/dL decreased from Period I (10.6%) to Period II (3.3%) [95% CI, 5.7, 8.8]; p<.001 and from Period I to Period III (3.9%) [95% CI, 5.0, 8.2]; p=.002. The 0.6% increase from Period II to Period III was not statistically significant [95% CI, -1.9, 0.57]; p=.30.

"Blood Lead Levels in Females of Childbearing Age in Flint, Michigan, and the Water Crisis","OBJECTIVE: To compare blood lead levels in females of childbearing age, 12-50 years, living within and adjacent to Flint, Michigan, before, during, and after the Flint River water exposure and compare the levels to those that have been shown to cause fetal loss and preterm birth. METHODS: The switch in the community water source to the Flint River occurred on April 25, 2014, and was reverted to the original source on October 15, 2015. Using a retrospective cross-sectional study design using geocoded blood lead levels obtained from all females of childbearing age available from a single hospital database, we compared blood lead levels for the following 18-month time periods: April 25, 2012-October 15, 2013 (PRE), April 25, 2014-October 15, 2015 (DURING), and April 25, 2016-October 15, 2017 (POST). RESULTS: Results are reported as geometric mean (95% CI). Within Flint, PRE blood lead levels in females of childbearing age were 0.69 micrograms/dL (95% CI 0.63-0.75), DURING blood lead levels were 0.65 micrograms/dL (95% CI 0.60-0.71), and POST blood lead levels were 0.55 micrograms/dL (95% CI 0.54-0.56). DURING Flint River water exposure blood lead levels were not significantly different than the PRE Flint River water time period. POST Flint River water exposure blood lead levels were significantly lower than both PRE and DURING levels. Overall, lower blood lead levels were found outside the Flint boundary in all cohorts. CONCLUSION: Blood lead levels in Flint females of childbearing age did not increase during the Flint River water exposure and subsequent 18-month time period. Mean blood lead levels during the Flint River water exposure are not consistent with the markedly higher blood lead levels reported in the literature to be associated with fetal loss, low birth weight, or preterm birth.","2019","Michigan","None","water"
"Lead release to potable water during the Flint, Michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data","Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals ( i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p < 0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015-August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg) = 0.483 x WLL90 (mu g/L) + 1.79: R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July -September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead >= 5 mu g/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p < 0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to preFWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R-2 = 0.30, p < 0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBLS) to historic lows (2016-2017 vs. 2012-2013; p < 0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure.

"Geographic Analysis of Blood Lead Levels and Neighborhood-Level Risk Factors Among Children Born in 2008-2010","Childhood lead exposure remains a public health concern, as it can lower a child's intelligence quotient and cause permanent neurological damage. The objective of this study was to identify census tracts with the highest risk for blood lead levels (BLLs) >= 5 mu g/dL in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We analyzed BLLs among children born in 2008-2010 who had at least one venous BLL test. A multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model was used to create risk scores and estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for BLLs >= 5 mu g/dL and census tract-level characteristics, including median age of housing, percent of Black residents, vacant properties, rental properties, adults living in poverty, and adults with a high school education. Of 49,246 children, 14.37% had more than one BLL >= 5 mu g/dL. Census tracts with a higher percentage of pre-1950 housing (OR = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.63, 2.04]), Black residents (OR = 3.22, 95% CI [2.70, 3.84]), vacant properties (OR = 1.45, 95% CI [1.23, 1.72]), and poverty (OR = 1.49, 95% CI [1.18, 1.89]) were associated with the highest risk. The mean risk score was 0.12 (range: 0.02-0.35). Our findings show that risk scores can help target prevention activities.","2019","Pennsylvania","None","None"
"Trends in Elevated Blood Lead Levels Using 5 and 10 µg/dL Levels of Concern Among Refugee Children Resettled in Massachusetts, 1998-2015","OBJECTIVES: Refugee children are known to have a high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs). We sought to determine trends in EBLLs among refugee children during an 18-year period and examine relationships between descriptive characteristics and EBLLs by using 10 µg/dL and 5 µg/dL levels of concern. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated refugee health screening data from Massachusetts for 1998 through 2015 for refugee children aged <7 years. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses of variables including sex, age, region of origin, anemia, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis test results, and anthropometric measurements and used both 5 µg/dL and 10 µg/dL levels of concern for EBLLs. RESULTS: Of 3421 eligible refugee children, 3054 (88.2%) were tested. Using 5 µg/dL and 10 µg/dL levels of concern, 1279 (41.9%) and 241 (7.9%) children, respectively, had EBLLs. Mean BLLs declined steadily from 7.58 µg/dL in 2004 to 4.03 µg/dL in 2015. African (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-3.43), East Asian and Pacific (aOR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.35-2.91), and South-Central Asian (aOR = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.53-4.01) regions of origin and anemia (aOR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.14 -1.97) were significantly associated with BLLs ≥5 µg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EBLLs among refugees compared with US-born children is high. Because EBBLs increase the risk for neurocognitive impairment in children, public health professionals, policy makers, researchers, refugee resettlement staff members, and health care providers must remain vigilant in screening for lead poisoning and educating refugees about the hazards posed to young children by lead.","2019","Massachusetts","None","None"
"Risky bismuth: Distinguishing between lead contamination sources in soils","In a broad environmental study in St. Joseph County, Indiana, elemental data from 2000 soil samples and 800 paint samples were collected with X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. The observed lead concentrations were compared to other elemental concentrations in these data. A strong correlation between lead and bismuth concentrations was observed in a subset of the soil samples and in nearly all of the paint samples, with lead levels approximately 150 times higher than bismuth. However, some soil samples contained lead with no bismuth present. Since most lead sources likely contain bismuth as an impurity from refining of native lead ore, but leaded gasoline does not contain any bismuth impurities due to the manufacturing process of tetraethyl lead, it may be possible to distinguish environmental lead sources by XRF. To test if leaded gasoline could be the source of lead in the subset of soil samples containing no bismuth, leaded paint samples were analyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which confirmed the presence of bismuth in leaded paint. Aviation gasoline, which contains tetraethyl lead, was also analyzed by ICP-OES to confirm the absence of bismuth in leaded gasoline. This discovery suggests that XRF can be used to rapidly distinguish different legacy lead contamination sources from one another. For low lead concentrations, elemental measurements of bismuth by ICP-OES can be used in environmental forensics to distinguish leaded gasoline contamination from other sources of lead.

"Blood lead levels in children in urban and rural areas: Using multilevel modeling to investigate impacts of gender, race, poverty, and the environment","Many studies of children's exposure to lead (Pb) are carried out in urban and industrialized environments. This study analyzed blood lead level (BLL) data collected from 2011 to 2016 from approximately 140,000 children ages <1 to 6 years across South Carolina (SC), including urban and rural areas. Individual-level characteristics included children's age, and race/ethnicity. Block group variables examined included population by race and ethnicity, households below the poverty level, median year homes built, urban/rural classification, and percent road coverage. BLL were higher in urban compared to rural children but increased to a greater extent in rural children from age < 1 year to 2 years. Road coverage was strongly associated with higher BLL in urban areas, and with home age more weakly, but neither road coverage nor home age was associated with BLL in rural areas. Young urban children may receive greater exposure to Pb from house dust and outdoor legacy Pb contamination, and young rural children through diet and drinking water. Black children had higher BLL in urban areas than white children, and the converse was true in rural areas. Population data indicated that rural areas had more poverty than urban areas, but strong associations between increased children's BLL and either ethnicity or socio-economic status (SES) at the block group level was not observed, likely due to distinct characteristics of poverty and geographic distribution by ethnicity in urban as compared to rural areas of SC. Individual demographics and environmental characteristics may be more closely associated with BLL than geographically aggregated SES and race/ethnicity characteristics. Interventions to reduce children's exposure to Pb should occur at as early an age as possible, and differences between rural and urban areas should be considered as interventions are developed to reduce children's BLL.","2019","South Carolina","None","water"
"Contributions of artifactual materials to the toxicity of anthropogenic soils and street dusts in a highly urbanized terrain","A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the presence of fly ash and other artifactual materials (AMs) significantly increases the toxicity of urban soil and street dust. AMs were distinguished as artifacts (artificial particles > 2 mm in size), and particulate artifacts (<2 mm in size); street dust was the <63 mu m fraction of street sediments. Reference artifacts, street dusts, and topsoils representing different land use types in Detroit, Michigan were analyzed for miscellaneous radionuclides, trace elements, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and acetic acid-extractable (leachable) Pb. Background levels were established using native glacial sediments. Street sediments were found to have a roadside provenance, hence street dusts inherited their contamination primarily from local soils. All soils and dusts had radionuclide concentrations similar to background levels, and radiological hazard indices within the safe range. Artifacts, fly ash-impacted soils and street dusts contained elevated concentrations of toxic trace elements, which varied with land use type, but none produced a significant amount of leachable Pb. It is inferred that toxic elements in AMs are not bioavailable because they are occluded within highly insoluble materials. Hence, these results do not support our hypothesis. Rather, AMs contribute to artificially-elevated total concentrations leading to an overestimation of toxicity. MS increased with increasing total concentration, hence proximal sensing can be used to map contamination level, but the weak correlation between total and leachable Pb suggests that such maps do not necessarily indicate the associated biohazard. Home site soils with total Pb concentrations >500 mg kg(-1) were sporadically toxic. Thus, these results argue against street dust as the local cause of seasonally elevated blood-Pb levels in children. Lead-bearing home site soil tracked directly indoors to form house dust is an alternative exposure pathway. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2019","Michigan","None","soil"
"Water lead exposure risk in Flint, Michigan after switchback in water source: Implications for lead service line replacement policy","In February of 2016, the City of Flint, Michigan commenced the FAST start initiative with the aim ""to get the lead out of Flint"" by replacing lead and galvanized steel service lines throughout the city. An estimated 29,100 parcels are scheduled for service line replacement (SLR) at an expected cost of $172 million. The lead exposure benefits of SLR are evaluated by analyzing Sentinel data on hundreds of repeatedly sampled homes in Flint from February 16, 2016 to July 21, 2017, comparing water lead (WL) in homes with and without lead service lines. Samples taken from homes with lead service lines were significantly more likely to exceed specified thresholds of WL than homes without lead service lines. Second, regardless of service line material type, sampled homes experienced significant reductions in WL with elapsed time from Flint's switchback to water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. Third, the risk of exceedance of WL > 15 mu g/L was uncorrelated with service line material type. These results are robust to sample restrictions, period stratification, time operations, reference group definitions, and statistical modeling procedures. On the question of what is gained from SLR over optimal corrosion control techniques, we simulated age-specific lead uptake (mu g/day) and blood lead levels (mu g/dL) for children in Flint at 16 and 90 weeks of elapsed time from Flint's switchback to Detroit water. At 90 weeks from the switchback in water source, the quantity of water lead consumed by children in homes with lead service lines decreased 93%, as compared to 16 weeks. Lead exposure benefits of SLR have declined in time, with modest differences in lead uptake across homes with different service lines. In light of results, policy considerations for Flint and nationwide are discussed.","2020","Michigan","water","water"
"Lead in drinking water at North Carolina childcare centers: Piloting a citizen science-based testing strategy","Drinking water is a lingering hazard in the effort to eliminate childhood exposure to lead (Pb), a neurotoxin that affects cognitive and behavioral development. This study characterized Pb in municipal drinking water at North Carolina, US, childcare centers. The study also demonstrates a scalable, citizen science-based drinking water testing strategy for Pb at childcare centers.Licensed childcare centers in four North Carolina counties were recruited. One administrator per center completed a survey and was trained to collect first-draw drinking water samples in their center. Samples were shipped with pre-paid labels for laboratory analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Multilevel logistic regression and Bayesian network analysis were used to identify factors associated with a risk of exceeding the 1 μg/L American Academy of Pediatrics reference level and the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 15 μg/L treatment-based action level. Results were provided to centers along with risk mitigation recommendations.Of 103 enrolled centers, 86 completed the study, submitting 1,266 drinking water samples in total. Approximately 77% of drinking water samples contained detectable Pb (≥0.1 μg/L), and 97% of centers had at least one drinking water sample with detectable Pb. More than 63% of centers had at least one drinking water sample with >1 μg/L Pb, and 17% of centers had at least one drinking water sample with Pb above 15 μg/L. There was high variability in Pb concentrations at water points within the same center.This study demonstrated a high prevalence and variability of Pb in first-draw samples of drinking water at childcare centers in North Carolina, US. Results underscore the importance of testing for Pb at every tap used for drinking and cooking in childcare centers. The use of employees as citizen scientists is a feasible strategy to identify Pb in specific drinking water taps.","2020","North Carolina","water","water"
"Policy Changes and Child Blood Lead Levels by Age 2 Years for Children Born in Illinois, 2001-2014","Objectives. To evaluate how lowering the blood lead level (BLL) intervention threshold affects childhood lead testing policy.Methods. We geocoded 4.19 million Illinois lead testing records (2001-2016) and linked to 2.37 million birth records (2001-2014), data on housing age, industrial emissions, and roads. We used multinomial logistic regression to determine predictors of BLLs of 10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) or greater, 5 to 9 µg/dL, and 4 µg/dL.Results. We found that 2.2% of children had BLLs of 10 µg/dL or greater, 8.9% had BLLs of 5 to 9 µg/dL, and 5.7% had BLLs of 4 µg/dL. Pre-1930 housing was associated with more than 2- to 4-fold increased relative risk of BLLs above all thresholds. Housing built in 1951 to 1978 was associated with increased relative risk of BLLs of 5 to 9 µg/dL (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06, 1.21) but not with increased relative risk of BLLs of 10 µg/dL or greater (RRR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.84, 1.16). At a given address, previous BLLs of 5 to 9 µg/dL or BLLs of 10 µg/dL or greater were associated with increased risk of BLLs of 5 to 9 µg/dL or BLLs of 10 µg/dL or greater among current occupants by 2.37- (95% CI = 2.20, 2.54) fold and 4.08- (95% CI = 3.69, 4.52) fold, respectively.Conclusions. The relative importance of determinants of above-threshold BLLs changes with decreasing intervention thresholds.Public Health Implications. States may need to update lead screening guidelines when decreasing the intervention threshold.","2020","Illinois","None","None"
"Prediction of Children's Blood Lead Levels from Exposure to Lead in Schools' Drinking Water-A Case Study in Tennessee, USA","Lead (Pb) exposure can delay children's mental development and cause behavioral disorders and IQ deficits. With children spending a significant portion of their time at schools, it is critical to investigate the lead concentration in schools' drinking water to prevent children's exposure. The objectives of this work were to predict students' geometric mean (GM) blood lead levels (BLLs), the fractions of at-risk students (those with BLLs > 5 mu g/dL), and the total number of at-risk students in one Tennessee school district. School drinking water lead concentration data collected in 2019 were input into the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) model and the Bowers' model to predict BLLs for elementary school students and secondary school students, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for both models. Drinking water concentrations were qualitatively compared with data collected in 2017. Two scenarios were evaluated for each model to provide upper and median estimates. The weighted GM BLL upper and median estimates for elementary school students were 2.35 mu g/dL and 0.99 mu g/dL, respectively. This equated to an upper estimate of 1300 elementary school students (5.8%) and a median estimate of 140 elementary school students (0.6%) being at risk of elevated BLLs. Similarly, the weighted GM BLL upper and median estimates for secondary school students were 2.99 mu g/dL and 1.53 mu g/dL, respectively, and equated to an upper estimate of 6900 secondary school students (13.6%) and a median estimate of 300 secondary school students (0.6%) being at risk of elevated BLLs. Drinking water remediation efforts are recommended for schools exhibiting water lead concentrations greater than 15 mu g/L. Site-specific soil lead concentration data are recommended since the IEUBK was deemed sensitive to soil lead concentrations. For this reason, soil lead remediation may have a greater impact on lowering children's BLLs than drinking water lead remediation. Remediation efforts are especially vital at elementary schools to reduce the population's baseline BLL and thus the BLL projected by Bowers' model.","2020","Tennessee","None","water"
"Children drinking private well water have higher blood lead than those with city water","Although the Flint, Michigan, water crisis renewed concerns about lead (Pb) in city drinking water, little attention has been paid to Pb in private wells, which provide drinking water for 13% of the US population. This study evaluates the risk of Pb exposure in children in households relying on private wells. It is based on a curated dataset of blood Pb records from 59,483 North Carolina children matched with household water source information. We analyze the dataset for statistical associations between children's blood Pb and household drinking water source. The analysis shows that children in homes relying on private wells have 25% increased odds (95% CI 6.2 to 48%, P < 0.01) of elevated blood Pb, compared with children in houses served by a community water system that is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. This increased Pb exposure is likely a result of corrosion of household plumbing and well components, because homes relying on private wells rarely treat their water to prevent corrosion. In contrast, corrosion con-trol is required in regulated community water systems. These find-ings highlight the need for targeted outreach to prevent Pb exposure for the 42.5 million Americans depending on private wells for their drinking water.","2020","Michigan","water","water"
